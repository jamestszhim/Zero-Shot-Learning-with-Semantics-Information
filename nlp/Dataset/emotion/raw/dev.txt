noemo	fairytale_sentences	As soon as they had passed, little Benjamin Bunny slid down into the road, and set off--with a hop, skip, and a jump--to call upon his relations, who lived in the wood at the back of Mr. McGregor's garden.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	That wood was full of rabbit holes; and in the neatest, sandiest hole of all lived Benjamin's aunt and his cousins--Flopsy, Mopsy, Cotton-tail, and Peter.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	Old Mrs. Rabbit was a widow; she earned her living by knitting rabbit-wool mittens and muffatees (I once bought a pair at a bazaar).
noemo	fairytale_sentences	She also sold herbs, and rosemary tea, and rabbit-tobacco (which is what we call lavender).
noemo	fairytale_sentences	Peter was sitting by himself.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	"Peter," said little Benjamin, in a whisper, "who has got your clothes?"
noemo	fairytale_sentences	Little Benjamin sat down beside his cousin and assured him that Mr. McGregor had gone out in a gig, and Mrs. McGregor also; and certainly for the day, because she was wearing her best bonnet.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	Peter said he hoped that it would rain.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	At this point old Mrs. Rabbit's voice was heard inside the rabbit hole, calling: "Cotton-tail!
noemo	fairytale_sentences	Cotton-tail! fetch some more camomile!"
noemo	fairytale_sentences	Peter said he thought he might feel better if he went for a walk.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	They went away hand in hand, and got upon the flat top of the wall at the bottom of the wood.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	From here they looked down into Mr. McGregor's garden.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	Peter's coat and shoes were plainly to be seen upon the scarecrow, topped with an old tam-o'-shanter of Mr. McGregor's.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	Little Benjamin said: "It spoils people's clothes to squeeze under a gate; the proper way to get in is to climb down a pear-tree."
noemo	fairytale_sentences	Peter fell down head first; but it was of no consequence, as the bed below was newly raked and quite soft.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	It had been sown with lettuces.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	They left a great many odd little footmarks all over the bed, especially little Benjamin, who was wearing clogs.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	Little Benjamin said that the first thing to be done was to get back Peter's clothes, in order that they might be able to use the pocket- handkerchief.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	They took them off the scarecrow.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	There had been rain during the night; there was water in the shoes, and the coat was somewhat shrunk.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	Benjamin tried on the tam-o'- shanter, but it was too big for him.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	Then he suggested that they should fill the pocket-handkerchief with onions, as a little present for his Aunt.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	He said that he was in the habit of coming to the garden with his father to get lettuces for their Sunday dinner.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	(The name of little Benjamin's papa was old Mr. Benjamin Bunny.)
noemo	fairytale_sentences	The lettuces certainly were very fine.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	Presently he dropped half the onions.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	Little Benjamin said that it was not possible to get back up the pear-tree with a load of vegetables.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	They went along a little walk on planks, under a sunny, red brick wall.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	Presently Peter let the pocket- handkerchief go again.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	They got amongst flower-pots, and frames, and tubs.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	This is what those little rabbits saw round that corner!
noemo	fairytale_sentences	Little Benjamin took one look, and then, in half a minute less than no time, he hid himself and Peter and the onions underneath a large basket.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	. . .
noemo	fairytale_sentences	The cat got up and stretched herself, and came and sniffed at the basket.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	Perhaps she liked the smell of onions!
noemo	fairytale_sentences	Anyway, she sat down upon the top of the basket.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	She sat there for FIVE HOURS.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	The sun got round behind the wood, and it was quite late in the afternoon; but still the cat sat upon the basket.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	At length there was a pitter-patter, pitter-patter, and some bits of mortar fell from the wall above.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	The cat looked up and saw old Mr. Benjamin Bunny prancing along the top of the wall of the upper terrace.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	He was smoking a pipe of rabbit- tobacco, and had a little switch in his hand.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	He was looking for his son.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	Old Mr. Bunny had no opinion whatever of cats.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	He took a tremendous jump off the top of the wall on to the top of the cat, and cuffed it off the basket, and kicked it into the greenhouse, scratching off a handful of fur.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	When old Mr. Bunny had driven the cat into the greenhouse, he locked the door.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	Then he took out his nephew Peter.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	Then he took out the handkerchief of onions, and marched out of the garden.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	It looked as though some person had been walking all over the garden in a pair of clogs--only the footmarks were too ridiculously little!
noemo	fairytale_sentences	Cotton-tail and Peter folded up the pocket-handkerchief, and old Mrs. Rabbit strung up the onions and hung them from the kitchen ceiling, with the bunches of herbs and the rabbit- tobacco.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	Once upon a time there was a very beautiful doll's-house; it was red brick with white windows, and it had real muslin curtains and a front door and a chimney.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	It belonged to two Dolls called Lucinda and Jane; at least it belonged to Lucinda, but she never ordered meals.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	Jane was the Cook; but she never did any cooking, because the dinner had been bought ready-made, in a box full of shavings.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	There were two red lobsters and a ham, a fish, a pudding, and some pears and oranges.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	They would not come off the plates, but they were extremely beautiful.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	One morning Lucinda and Jane had gone out for a drive in the doll's perambulator.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	There was no one in the nursery, and it was very quiet.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	Presently there was a little scuffling, scratching noise in a corner near the fireplace, where there was a hole under the skirting-board.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	Tom Thumb put out his head for a moment, and then popped it in again.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	Tom Thumb was a mouse.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	A minute afterwards, Hunca Munca, his wife, put her head out, too; and when she saw that there was no one in the nursery, she ventured out on the oilcloth under the coal-box.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	The doll's-house stood at the other side of the fire-place.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	They pushed the front door--it was not fast.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	Tom Thumb and Hunca Munca went upstairs and peeped into the dining-room.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	Such a lovely dinner was laid out upon the table!
noemo	fairytale_sentences	There were tin spoons, and lead knives and forks, and two dolly-chairs--all SO convenient!
noemo	fairytale_sentences	Tom Thumb set to work at once to carve the ham.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	It was a beautiful shiny yellow, streaked with red.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	You have a try, Hunca Munca."
noemo	fairytale_sentences	Hunca Munca stood up in her chair, and chopped at the ham with another lead knife.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	The ham broke off the plate with a jerk, and rolled under the table.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	"Let it alone," said Tom Thumb; "give me some fish, Hunca Munca!"
noemo	fairytale_sentences	Hunca Munca tried every tin spoon in turn; the fish was glued to the dish.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	He put the ham in the middle of the floor, and hit it with the tongs and with the shovel--bang, bang, smash, smash!
noemo	fairytale_sentences	The ham flew all into pieces, for underneath the shiny paint it was made of nothing but plaster!
noemo	fairytale_sentences	They broke up the pudding, the lobsters, the pears and the oranges.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	As the fish would not come off the plate, they put it into the red-hot crinkly paper fire in the kitchen; but it would not burn either.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	Tom Thumb went up the kitchen chimney and looked out at the top-- there was no soot.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	She found some tiny canisters upon the dresser, labelled-- Rice--Coffee--Sago--but when she turned them upside down, there was nothing inside except red and blue beads.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	He took Jane's clothes out of the chest of drawers in her bedroom, and he threw them out of the top floor window.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	But Hunca Munca had a frugal mind.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	After pulling half the feathers out of Lucinda's bolster, she remembered that she herself was in want of a feather bed.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	With Tom Thumbs's assistance she carried the bolster downstairs, and across the hearth-rug.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	It was difficult to squeeze the bolster into the mouse- hole; but they managed it somehow.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	Then Hunca Munca went back and fetched a chair, a book-case, a bird- cage, and several small odds and ends.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	The book-case and the bird- cage refused to go into the mousehole.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	Hunca Munca left them behind the coal-box, and went to fetch a cradle.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	Hunca Munca was just returning with another chair, when suddenly there was a noise of talking outside upon the landing.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	The book-case and the bird-cage were rescued from under the coal- box--but Hunca Munca has got the cradle, and some of Lucinda's clothes.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	She also has some useful pots and pans, and several other things.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	So that is the story of the two Bad Mice,--but they were not so very very naughty after all, because Tom Thumb paid for everything he broke.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	He found a crooked sixpence under the hearth-rug; and upon Christmas Eve, he and Hunca Munca stuffed it into one of the stockings of Lucinda and Jane.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	And very early every morning-- before anybody is awake--Hunca Munca comes with her dust-pan and her broom to sweep the Dollies' house!
noemo	fairytale_sentences	This is a fierce bad Rabbit; look at his savage whiskers and his claws and his turned-up tail.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	This is a nice gentle Rabbit.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	His mother has given him a carrot.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	The bad Rabbit would like some carrot.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	He doesn't say "Please."
noemo	fairytale_sentences	He takes it!
noemo	fairytale_sentences	And he scratches the good Rabbit very badly.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	This is a man with a gun.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	He sees something sitting on a bench.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	He comes creeping up behind the trees.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	And then he shoots--BANG!
noemo	fairytale_sentences	This is what happens--
noemo	fairytale_sentences	But this is all he finds on the bench when he rushes up with his gun.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	The good Rabbit peeps out of its hole . . .
noemo	fairytale_sentences	I have made many books about well-behaved people.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	Now, for a change, I am going to make a story about two disagreeable people, called Tommy Brock and Mr. Tod.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	Nobody could call Mr. Tod "nice."
noemo	fairytale_sentences	He was of a wandering habit and he had foxy whiskers; they never knew where he would be next.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	In winter and early spring he might generally be found in an earth amongst the rocks at the top of Bull Banks, under Oatmeal Crag.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	He had half a dozen houses, but he was seldom at home.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	The houses were not always empty when Mr. Tod moved OUT; because sometimes Tommy Brock moved IN; (without asking leave).
noemo	fairytale_sentences	Tommy Brock was a short bristly fat waddling person with a grin; he grinned all over his face.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	He was not nice in his habits.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	He ate wasp nests and frogs and worms; and he waddled about by moonlight, digging things up.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	His clothes were very dirty; and as he slept in the daytime, he always went to bed in his boots.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	And the bed which he went to bed in was generally Mr. Tod's.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	Now Tommy Brock did occasionally eat rabbit pie; but it was only very little young ones occasionally, when other food was really scarce.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	Old Mr. Bouncer was stricken in years.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	He sat in the spring sunshine outside the burrow, in a muffler; smoking a pipe of rabbit tobacco.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	He lived with his son Benjamin Bunny and his daughter-in-law Flopsy, who had a young family.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	Old Mr. Bouncer was in charge of the family that afternoon, because Benjamin and Flopsy had gone out.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	The little rabbit babies were just old enough to open their blue eyes and kick.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	They lay in a fluffy bed of rabbit wool and hay, in a shallow burrow, separate from the main rabbit hole.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	To tell the truth--old Mr. Bouncer had forgotten them.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	He sat in the sun, and conversed cordially with Tommy Brock, who was passing through the wood with a sack and a little spud which he used for digging, and some mole traps.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	Tommy Brock squeezed himself into the rabbit hole with alacrity.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	When Flopsy and Benjamin came back old Mr. Bouncer woke up.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	Tommy Brock and all the young rabbit babies had disappeared!
noemo	fairytale_sentences	But the smell of badger was undeniable; and there were round heavy footmarks in the sand.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	There was not much difficulty in tracking him; he had left his foot- mark and gone slowly up the winding footpath through the wood.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	Here he had rooted up the moss and wood sorrel.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	There he had dug quite a deep hole for dog darnel; and had set a mole trap.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	A little stream crossed the way.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	Benjamin skipped lightly over dry-foot; the badger's heavy steps showed plainly in the mud.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	The path led to a part of the thicket where the trees had been cleared; there were leafy oak stumps, and a sea of blue hyacinths --but the smell that made Benjamin stop was NOT the smell of flowers!
noemo	fairytale_sentences	Mr. Tod's stick house was before him; and, for once, Mr. Tod was at home.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	There was not only a foxy flavor in proof of it--there was smoke coming out of the broken pail that served as a chimney.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	Benjamin Bunny sat up, staring, his whiskers twitched.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	Inside the stick house somebody dropped a plate, and said something.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	He never stopped till he came to the other side of the wood.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	Apparently Tommy Brock had turned the same way.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	Upon the top of the wall there were again the marks of
noemo	fairytale_sentences	badger; and some ravellings of a sack had caught on a briar.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	Benjamin climbed over the wall, into a meadow.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	He found another mole trap newly set; he was still upon the track of Tommy Brock.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	It was getting late in the afternoon.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	One of them in a blue coat, by himself, was busily hunting for dandelions.-- "Cousin Peter!
noemo	fairytale_sentences	"Yes, yes; not ten minutes since ... he said they were CATERPILLARS; I did think they were kicking rather hard, for caterpillars."
noemo	fairytale_sentences	"He had a sack with something live in it; I watched him set a mole trap.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	Let me use my mind, Cousin Benjamin; tell me from the beginning," Benjamin did so.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	Your family is alive and kicking; and Tommy Brock has had refreshments.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	He will probably go to sleep, and keep them for breakfast."
noemo	fairytale_sentences	"Cousin Benjamin, compose yourself.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	I know very well which way.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	Because Mr. Tod was at home in the stick house he has gone to Mr. Tod's other house, at the top of Bull Banks.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	I partly know, because he offered to leave any message at Sister Cottontail's; he said he would be passing."
noemo	fairytale_sentences	(Cottontail had married a black rabbit, and gone to live on the hill.)
noemo	fairytale_sentences	They crossed several fields and began to climb the hill; the tracks of Tommy Brock were plainly to be seen.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	He seemed to have put down the sack every dozen yards, to rest.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	The sunshine was still warm and slanting on the hill pastures.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	Half way up, Cottontail was sitting in her doorway, with four or five half- grown little rabbits playing about her; one black and the others brown.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	Cottontail had seen Tommy Brock passing in the distance.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	Asked whether her husband was at home she replied that Tommy Brock had rested twice while she watched him.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	They climbed up and up;--"He was at home; I saw his black ears peeping out of the hole."
noemo	fairytale_sentences	"They live too near the rocks to quarrel with their neighbors.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	The trees grew amongst heaped up rocks; and there, beneath a crag, Mr. Tod had made one of his homes.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	It was at the top of a steep bank; the rocks and bushes overhung it.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	This house was something between a cave, a prison, and a tumbledown pigsty.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	There was a strong door, which was shut and locked.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	The setting sun made the window panes glow like red flame; but the kitchen fire was not alight.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	It was neatly laid with dry sticks, as the rabbits could see, when they peeped through the window.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	There was an immense empty pie dish of blue willow pattern, and a large carving knife and fork, and a chopper.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	At the other end of the table was a partly unfolded tablecloth, a plate, a tumbler, a knife and fork, salt cellar, mustard and a chair-- in short, preparations for one person's supper.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	No person was to be seen, and no young rabbits.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	The kitchen was empty and silent; the clock had run down.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	Peter and Benjamin flattened their noses against the window, and stared into the dusk.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	Then they scrambled round the rocks to the other side of the house.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	It was damp and smelly, and over- grown with thorns and briars.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	They crept up to the bedroom window.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	It was closed and bolted like the kitchen.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	But there were signs that this window had been recently open; the cobwebs were disturbed, and there were fresh dirty footmarks upon the windowsill.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	The room inside was so dark that at first they could make out nothing; but they could hear a noise--a slow deep regular snoring grunt.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	And as their eyes became accustomed to the darkness, they perceived that somebody was asleep on Mr. Tod's bed, curled up under the blanket.--"He has gone to bed in his boots," whispered Peter.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	Tommy Brock's snores continued, grunty and regular from Mr. Tod's bed.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	Nothing could be seen of the young family.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	The sun had set; an owl began to hoot in the wood.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	It was a shocking place, and very dark.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	They went back to the front of the house, and tried in every way to move the bolt of the kitchen window.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	They tried to push up a rusty nail between the window sashes; but it was of no use, especially without a light.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	They sat side by side outside the window, whispering and listening.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	In half an hour the moon rose over the wood.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	It shone full and clear and cold, upon the house, amongst the rocks, and in at the kitchen window.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	The moonbeams twinkled on the carving knife and the pie dish, and made a path of brightness across the dirty floor.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	The light showed a little door in a wall beside the kitchen fireplace --a little iron door belonging to a brick oven of that old-fashioned sort that used to be heated with faggots of wood.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	But there really was not very much comfort in the discovery.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	They could not open the window; and although the young family was alive the little rabbits were quite incapable of letting themselves out; they were not old enough to crawl.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	After much whispering, Peter and Benjamin decided to dig a tunnel.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	They began to burrow a yard or two lower down the bank.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	They hoped that they might be able to work between the large stones under the house; the kitchen floor was so dirty that it was impossible to say whether it was made of earth or flags.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	They dug and dug for hours.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	They could not tunnel straight on account of stones; but by the end of the night they were under the kitchen floor.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	Benjamin was on his back scratching upwards.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	Peter's claws were worn down; he was outside the tunnel, shuffling sand away.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	He called out that it was morning--sunrise; and that the jays were making a noise down below in the woods.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	Benjamin Bunny came out of the dark tunnel shaking the sand from his ears; he cleaned his face with his paws.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	Every minute the sun shone warmer on the top of the hill.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	In the valley there was a sea of white mist, with golden tops of trees showing through.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	They did the most foolish thing that they could have done.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	It was his own fault; but it was a china plate, the last of the dinner service that had belonged to his grandmother, old Vixen Tod.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	First he tried the pollard willow, but it was damp; and the otters had left a dead fish near it.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	Mr. Tod likes nobody's leavings but his own.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	No one else grubs up the moss so wantonly as Tommy Brock.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	It flew from tree to tree and scolded, warning every rabbit within hearing that either a cat or a fox was coming up the plantation.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	He approached his house very carefully, with a large rusty key.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	He sniffed and his whiskers bristled.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	The house was locked up, but Mr. Tod had his doubts whether it was empty.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	He turned the rusty key in the lock; the rabbits below could hear it.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	Mr. Tod opened the door cautiously and went in.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	There was Mr. Tod's chair, and Mr. Tod's pie dish, and his knife and fork and mustard and salt cellar, and his tablecloth, that he had left folded up in the dresser --all set out for supper (or breakfast) --without doubt for that odious Tommy Brock.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	There was a smell of fresh earth and dirty badger, which fortunately overpowered all smell of rabbit.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	But what absorbed Mr. Tod's attention was a noise, a deep slow regular snoring grunting noise, coming from his own bed.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	He peeped through the hinges of the half-open bedroom door.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	Then he turned and came out of the house in a hurry.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	For the next twenty minutes Mr. Tod kept creeping cautiously into the house, and retreating hurriedly out again.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	By degrees he ventured further in--right into the bed- room.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	He was lying on his back with his mouth open, grinning from ear to ear.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	He snored peacefully and regularly; but one eye was not perfectly shut.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	Mr. Tod came in and out of the bedroom.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	Twice he brought in his walking stick, and once he brought in the coal scuttle.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	But he thought better of it, and took them away.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	When he came back after removing the coal scuttle, Tommy Brock was lying a little more sideways; but he seemed even sounder asleep.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	Mr. Tod came back yet again into the bedroom with a clothes line.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	He stood a minute watching Tommy Brock and listening attentively to the snores.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	They were very loud indeed, but seemed quite natural.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	Mr. Tod turned his back towards the bed, and undid the window.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	Tommy Brock, who had opened one eye--shut it hastily.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	The snores continued.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	Mr. Tod's proceedings were peculiar, and rather difficult (because the bed was between the window and the door of the bedroom).
noemo	fairytale_sentences	He opened the window a little way, and pushed out the greater part of the clothes line on to the window- sill.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	The rest of the line, with a hook at the end, remained in his hand.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	Tommy Brock snored conscientiously.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	Mr. Tod stood and looked at him for a minute; then he left the room again.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	There was a noise outside the window.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	Tommy Brock shut his eyes in a hurry.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	Mr. Tod had gone out at the front door, and round to the back of the house.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	On the way, he stumbled over the rabbit burrow.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	If he had had any idea who was inside it he would have pulled them out quickly.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	His foot went through the tunnel nearly upon the top of Peter Rabbit and Benjamin; but, fortunately, he thought that it was some more of Tommy Brock's work.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	He took up the coil of line from the sill, listened for a moment, and then tied the rope to a tree.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	Tommy Brock watched him with one eye, through the window.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	Mr. Tod fetched a large heavy pailful of water from the spring, and staggered with it through the kitchen into his bedroom.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	Tommy Brock snored industriously, with rather a snort.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	Mr. Tod put down the pail beside the bed, took up the end of rope with the hook--hesitated, and looked at Tommy Brock.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	Mr. Tod gingerly mounted a chair by the head of the bedstead.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	His legs were dangerously near to Tommy Brock's teeth.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	He reached up and put the end of rope, with the hook, over the head of the tester bed, where the curtains ought to hang.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	(Mr.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	Tod's curtains were folded up, and put away, owing to the house being unoccupied.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	So was the counterpane.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	Tommy Brock was covered with a blanket only.)
noemo	fairytale_sentences	Mr. Tod standing on the unsteady chair looked down upon him attentively; he really was a first prize sound sleeper!
noemo	fairytale_sentences	It seemed as though nothing would waken him--not even the flapping rope across the bed.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	Mr. Tod descended safely from the chair, and endeavored to get up again with the pail of water.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	He intended to hang it from the hook, dangling over the head of Tommy Brock, in order to make a sort of shower-bath, worked by a string, through the window.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	But, naturally, being a thin- legged person (though vindictive and sandy whiskered)--he was quite unable to lift the heavy weight to the level of the hook and rope.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	He very nearly overbalanced himself.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	The snores became more and more apoplectic.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	One of Tommy Brock's hind legs twitched under the blanket, but still he slept on peacefully.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	Mr. Tod and the pail descended from the chair without accident.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	After considerable thought, he emptied the water into a wash basin and jug.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	The empty pail was not too heavy for him; he slung it up wobbling over the head of Tommy Brock.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	Surely there never was such a sleeper!
noemo	fairytale_sentences	Mr. Tod got up and down, down and up on the chair.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	As he could not lift the whole pailful of water at once he fetched a milk jug and ladled quarts of water into the pail by degrees.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	The pail got fuller and fuller, and swung like a pendulum.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	Occasionally a drop splashed over; but still Tommy Brock snored regularly and never moved,--except in one eye.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	At last Mr. Tod's preparations were complete.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	The pail was full of water; the rope was tightly strained over the top of the bed, and across the windowsill to the tree outside.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	"It will make a great mess in my bedroom; but I could never sleep in that bed again without a spring cleaning of some sort," said Mr. Tod.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	Mr. Tod took a last look at the badger and softly left the room.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	He went out of the house, shutting the front door.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	The rabbits heard his footsteps over the tunnel.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	He ran round behind the house, intending to undo the rope in order to let fall the pailful of water upon Tommy Brock--
noemo	fairytale_sentences	He went into the kitchen, lighted the fire and boiled the kettle; for the moment he did not trouble himself to cook the baby rabbits.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	When Mr. Tod got to the tree, he found that the weight and strain had dragged the knot so tight that it was past untying.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	He was obliged to gnaw it with his teeth.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	He chewed and gnawed for more than twenty minutes.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	Inside the house there was a great crash and splash, and the noise of a pail rolling over and over.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	But no screams.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	Then he peeped in at the window.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	The water was dripping from the bed, the pail had rolled into a corner.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	In the middle of the bed, under the blanket, was a wet SOMETHING --much flattened in the middle, where the pail had caught it (as it were across the tummy).
noemo	fairytale_sentences	Its head was covered by the wet blanket, and it was NOT SNORING ANY LONGER.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	There was nothing stirring, and no sound except the drip, drop, drop, drip, of water trickling from the mattress.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	Mr. Tod watched it for half an hour; his eyes glistened.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	Then he cut a caper, and became so bold that he even tapped at the window; but the bundle never moved.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	I will bring my bedding out, and dry it in the sun," said Mr. Tod.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	"I will wash the tablecloth and spread it on the grass in the sun to bleach.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	And the blanket must be hung up in the wind; and the bed must be thoroughly disinfected, and aired with a warming-pan; and warmed with a hot water bottle."
noemo	fairytale_sentences	"I will get soft soap, and monkey soap, and all sorts of soap; and soda and scrubbing brushes; and persian powder; and carbolic to remove the smell.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	Perhaps I may have to burn sulphur."
noemo	fairytale_sentences	He hurried round the house to get a shovel from the kitchen-- "First I will arrange the hole--then I will drag out that person in the blanket.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	. . ."
noemo	fairytale_sentences	He opened the door.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	. . .
noemo	fairytale_sentences	Tommy Brock was sitting at Mr. Tod's kitchen table, pouring out tea from Mr. Tod's teapot into Mr. Tod's teacup.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	Everything was upset except the kitchen table.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	And everything was broken, except the mantelpiece and the kitchen fender.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	The crockery was smashed to atoms.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	The chairs were broken, and the window, and the clock fell with a crash, and there were handfuls of Mr. Tod's sandy whiskers.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	The vases fell off the mantelpiece, the cannisters fell off the shelf; the kettle fell off the hob.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	Tommy Brock put his foot in a jar of raspberry jam.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	And the boiling water out of the kettle fell upon the tail of Mr. Tod.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	As soon as the coast was clear, Peter Rabbit and Benjamin Bunny came out of the bushes.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	"No they are not."
noemo	fairytale_sentences	"What dreadful bad language!
noemo	fairytale_sentences	I think they have fallen down the stone quarry."
noemo	fairytale_sentences	Still Benjamin hesitated, and Peter kept pushing him--
noemo	fairytale_sentences	"Be quick, it's all right.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	Shut the oven door, Cousin Benjamin, so that he won't miss them."
noemo	fairytale_sentences	Decidedly there were lively doings in Mr. Tod's kitchen!
noemo	fairytale_sentences	The day passed heavily.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	Flopsy had taken away his pipe and hidden the tobacco.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	She had been having a complete turn out and spring cleaning, to relieve her feelings.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	She had just finished.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	He opened the oven door, felt inside, and found something warm and wriggling.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	He lifted it out carefully, and rejoined Peter Rabbit.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	Can we get away?
noemo	fairytale_sentences	Shall we hide, Cousin Peter?"
noemo	fairytale_sentences	Peter pricked his ears; distant sounds of fighting still echoed in the wood.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	Five minutes afterwards two breathless rabbits came scuttering away down Bull Banks, half carrying, half dragging a sack between them, bumpetty bump over the grass.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	They reached home safely, and burst into the rabbit hole.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	They soon recovered.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	A new long pipe and a fresh supply of rabbit tobacco was presented to Mr. Bouncer.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	Then Peter and Benjamin told their story--but they had not waited long enough to be able to tell the end of the battle between Tommy Brock and Mr. Tod.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	ONE would have thought that something important was going on in the duck-pond, but it was nothing after all.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	All the ducks lying quietly on the water or standing on their heads in it- for they could do that- at once swarm to the sides; the traces of their feet were seen in the wet earth, and their cackling was heard far and wide.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	The water, which a few moments before had been as clear and smooth as a mirror, became very troubled.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	Before, every tree, every neighbouring bush, the old farmhouse with the holes in the roof and the swallows' nest, and especially the great rose-bush full of flowers, had been reflected in it.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	The rose-bush covered the wall and hung out over the water, in which everything was seen as if in a picture, except that it all stood on its head; but when the water was troubled everything got mixed up, and the picture was gone.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	Two feathers which the fluttering ducks had lost floated up and down; suddenly they took a rush as if the wind were coming, but as it did not come they had to lie still, and the water once more became quiet and smooth.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	The roses were again reflected; they were very beautiful, but they did not know it, for no one had told them.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	"The only thing that I wish for is to be able to kiss the sun, because it is so warm and bright.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	I should also like to kiss those roses down in the water, which are so much like us, and the pretty little birds down in the nest.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	There are some up above too; they put out their heads and pipe softly; they have no feathers like their father and mother.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	The young ones above and below- those below were really only shadows in the water- were sparrows; their parents were sparrows too, and had taken possession of the empty swallows' nest of last year, and now lived in it as if it were their own property.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	"Are those the duck's children swimming here?" asked the young sparrows when they saw the feathers on the water.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	But ours are finer.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	Still, I should like to have them up in the nest, for they keep one warm.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	"Listen to the dear little birds up there," said the roses; "they begin to want to sing too, but are not able to manage it yet.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	But it will soon come.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	Suddenly two horses came galloping up to be watered.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	A peasant boy rode on one, and he had taken off all his clothes except his large broad black hat.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	The boy whistled like a bird, and rode into the pond where it was deepest, and as he passed the rose-bush he plucked a rose and stuck it in his hat.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	Now he looked dressed, and rode on.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	But none of them knew.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	"I should like to go out into the world for once," said one; "but here at home among our green leaves it is beautiful too.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	They meant the stars, but they knew no better.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	A rose-bush on the wall like that causes damp.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	I daresay it will be taken away; then we shall, perhaps, have some corn growing here.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	Every year, as I have been told by my mother, they fall off.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	The farmer's wife preserves them and strews salt among them; then they get a French name which I neither can pronounce nor care to, and are put into the fire to make a nice smell.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	Now you know."
noemo	fairytale_sentences	In the evening, when the gnats were playing about in the warm air and in the red clouds, the nightingale came and sang to the roses that the beautiful was like sunshine to the world, and that the beautiful lived for ever.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	The roses thought that the nightingale was singing about itself, and that one might easily have believed; they had no idea that the song was about them.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	"I understand the song of that bird very well," said the young sparrows.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	"There was only one word that was not clear to me.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	What does 'the beautiful' mean?"
noemo	fairytale_sentences	Up at the Hall, where the pigeons have their own house, and corn and peas are strewn before them every day- I have dined with them myself, and that you shall do in time, too; for tell me what company you keep and I'll tell you who you are- up at the Hall they have two birds with green necks and a crest upon their heads; they can spread out their tails like a great wheel, and these are so bright with various colours that it makes one's eyes ache.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	These birds are called peacocks, and that is 'the beautiful.'
noemo	fairytale_sentences	"I'll pluck them," piped the young sparrow, who had no feathers yet.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	On Sundays the young wife came down early, plucked a handful of the most beautiful roses, and put them into a glass of water, which she placed upon the cupboard.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	The same thing happened on the following Sunday, for every Sunday fresh roses were put into the glass; but the rose-bush bloomed as beautifully as ever.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	The young sparrows now had feathers, and wanted very much to fly with their mother; but she would not allow it, and so they had to stay at home.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	The boys came running up and seized her, and in no gentle way either.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	In the farmhouse was an old man who understood making soap into cakes and balls, both for shaving and washing.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	On seeing the sparrow which the boys had brought, and which they said they did not want, he asked, "Shall we make it look very pretty?"
noemo	fairytale_sentences	Out of his box, in which were the most beautiful colours, the old man took a quantity of shining leaf-gold, while the boys had to go and fetch some white of egg, with which the sparrow was to be smeared all over; the gold was stuck on to this, and the sparrow-mother was now gilded all over.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	Then the soap-man tore off a small piece from the red lining of his old jacket, and cutting it so as to make it look like a cock's comb, he stuck it to the bird's head.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	The other birds, too, now fell upon the sparrow and plucked off feather after feather until she fell bleeding into the rose-bush.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	Lean your little head against us.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	"Peep!" sounded from the nest.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	"Where can mother be so long?
noemo	fairytale_sentences	It's more than I can understand.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	It cannot be a trick of hers, and mean that we are now to take care of ourselves.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	She has left us the house as an inheritance; but to which of us is it to belong when we have families of our own?"
noemo	fairytale_sentences	"Yes, it won't do for you to stay with me when I increase my household with a wife and children,"' said the smallest.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	"I daresay I shall have more wives and children than you," said the second.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	That was their way of looking foolish.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	They could fly a little; by practice they learned to improve, and at last they agreed upon a sign by which to recognise each other if they should meet in the world later on.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	It was to be one "Peep!" and three scratches on the ground with the left foot.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	The young one who had remained behind in the nest made himself as broad as he could, for he was the proprietor.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	But this greatness did not last long.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	The two others, who wanted to marry, thus saved their lives by a stroke of luck.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	When the sun rose again and everything looked as refreshed as if it had had a quiet sleep, there only remained of the farmhouse a few black charred beams leaning against the chimney, which was now its own master.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	Thick smoke still rose from the ruins, but the rose-bush stood yonder, fresh, blooming, and untouched, every flower and every twig being reflected in the clear water.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	"How beautifully the roses bloom before the ruined house," exclaimed a passer-by.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	I must have that."
noemo	fairytale_sentences	And the man took out of his portfolio a little book with white leaves: he was a painter, and with his pencil he drew the smoking house, the charred beams and the overhanging chimney, which bent more and more; in the foreground he put the large, blooming rose-bush, which presented a charming view.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	For its sake alone the whole picture had been drawn.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	Later in the day the two sparrows who had been born there came by.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	Peep!
noemo	fairytale_sentences	That's what he has now for keeping the nest.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	The roses got off very well; there they still stand with their red cheeks.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	They certainly do not mourn at their neighbours' misfortunes.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	And away they went.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	On a beautiful sunny autumn day- one could almost have believed it was still the middle of summer- there hopped about in the dry clean-swept courtyard before the principal entrance of the Hall a number of black, white, and gaily-coloured pigeons, all shining in the sunlight.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	The pigeon-mothers said to their young ones: "Stand in groups, stand in groups! for that looks much better."
noemo	fairytale_sentences	"What kind of creatures are those little grey ones that run about behind us?" asked an old pigeon, with red and green in her eyes.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	"Little grey ones!
noemo	fairytale_sentences	Little grey ones!" she cried.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	We have always had the reputation of being pious, so we will allow them to pick up the corn with us; they don't interrupt our talk, and they scrape so prettily when they bow."
noemo	fairytale_sentences	Indeed they were continually making three foot-scrapings with the left foot and also said "Peep!"
noemo	fairytale_sentences	By this means they recognised each other, for they were the sparrows from the nest on the burned house.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	The pigeons strutted round one another, puffed out their chests mightily, and had their own private views and opinions.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	"Do you see how she swallows the peas?
noemo	fairytale_sentences	Curoo!
noemo	fairytale_sentences	Curoo!
noemo	fairytale_sentences	Curoo!
noemo	fairytale_sentences	Curoo!"
noemo	fairytale_sentences	"Stand in groups!
noemo	fairytale_sentences	Stand in groups!
noemo	fairytale_sentences	Little grey ones, little grey ones!
noemo	fairytale_sentences	Curoo, curoo, curoo!"
noemo	fairytale_sentences	So their chatter ran on, and so it will run on for thousands of years.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	"Peep!" said he; "I may venture that."
noemo	fairytale_sentences	"Peep!" said the other; "so may I, and something more too!" and he hopped into the room.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	No one was there; the third sparrow, seeing this, flew still farther into the room, exclaiming, "All or nothing!
noemo	fairytale_sentences	It is a curious man's nest all the same; and what have they put up here?
noemo	fairytale_sentences	What is it?"
noemo	fairytale_sentences	Close to the sparrows the roses were blooming; they were reflected in the water, and the charred beams leaned against the overhanging chimney.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	"Do tell me what this is.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	How comes this in a room at the Hall?"
noemo	fairytale_sentences	And all three sparrows wanted to fly over the roses and the chimney, but flew against a flat wall.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	It was all a picture, a great splendid picture, which the artist had painted from a sketch.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	Do you understand it?
noemo	fairytale_sentences	I don't."
noemo	fairytale_sentences	And they flew away, for some people came into the room.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	Days and years went by.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	They had little ones, and of course each one thought his own the handsomest and cleverest; one flew this way, another that, and when they met they recognised each other by their "Peep!" and the three scrapes with the left foot.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	The eldest had remained an old maid and had no nest nor young ones.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	It was her pet idea to see a great city, so she flew to Copenhagen.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	There was a large house painted in many gay colours standing close to the castle and the canal, upon which latter were to be seen many ships laden with apples and pottery.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	But in the middle of the tulip stood white men, made of marble; a few were of plaster; still, looked at with sparrows' eyes, that comes to the same thing.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	Up on the roof stood a metal chariot drawn by metal horses, and the goddess of Victory, also of metal, was driving.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	It was Thorwaldsen's Museum.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	Peep!
noemo	fairytale_sentences	But here it is larger than a peacock."
noemo	fairytale_sentences	She still remembered what in her childhood's days her mother had looked upon as the greatest among the beautiful.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	She flew down into the courtyard: there everything was extremely fine.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	Palms and branches were painted on the walls, and in the middle of the court stood a great blooming rose-tree spreading out its fresh boughs, covered with roses, over a grave.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	Thither flew the maiden sparrow, for she saw several of her own kind there.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	But to-day two old sparrows and a young one answered with a "peep" and the thrice-repeated scrape with the left foot.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	"Ah!
noemo	fairytale_sentences	They were two old ones from the nest and a little one of the family.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	"Do we meet here?
noemo	fairytale_sentences	It's a grand place, but there's not much to eat.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	Peep!"
noemo	fairytale_sentences	Many people came out of the side rooms where the beautiful marble statues stood and approached the grave where lay the great master who had created these works of art.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	They had come from afar: one from mighty England, others from Germany and France.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	The fairest of the ladies plucked one of the roses and hid it in her bosom.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	Then the sparrows thought that the roses reigned here, and that the house had been built for their sake.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	That appeared to them to be really too much, but since all the people showed their love for the roses, they did not wish to be behindhand.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	And so they really were.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	The architect had planted it upon Thorwaldsen's grave, where it bloomed as an emblem of 'the beautiful' and yielded fragrant red rose-leaves to be carried as mementoes to distant lands.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	"Have you obtained an appointment here in the city?" asked the sparrows.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	"Peep!" said the sparrows.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	"Yes, they are really our old neighbours; we remember their origin near the pond.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	Yes, some succeed while they are asleep.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	Ah! there's a faded leaf; I can see that quite plainly."
noemo	fairytale_sentences	And they pecked at it till it fell off.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	But the tree stood there fresher and greener than ever; the roses bloomed in the sunshine on Thorwaldsen's grave and became associated with his immortal name.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	He brought enormous wealth home from the conquered towns, and gradually accumulated in his residence riches which could nowhere be equalled.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	But I must have more- much more.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	He made war with all his neighbours, and defeated them.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	"Well," said the prince.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	And in his haughtiness and foolish presumption he ordered a magnificent ship to be constructed, with which he could sail through the air; it was gorgeously fitted out and of many colours; like the tail of a peacock, it was covered with thousands of eyes, but each eye was the barrel of a gun.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	The prince sat in the centre of the ship, and had only to touch a spring in order to make thousands of bullets fly out in all directions, while the guns were at once loaded again.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	Hundreds of eagles were attached to this ship, and it rose with the swiftness of an arrow up towards the sun.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	The earth was soon left far below, and looked, with its mountains and woods, like a cornfield where the plough had made furrows which separated green meadows; soon it looked only like a map with indistinct lines upon it; and at last it entirely disappeared in mist and clouds.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	Higher and higher rose the eagles up into the air; then God sent one of his numberless angels against the ship.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	The wicked prince showered thousands of bullets upon him, but they rebounded from his shining wings and fell down like ordinary hailstones.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	One drop of blood, one single drop, came out of the white feathers of the angel's wings and fell upon the ship in which the prince sat, burnt into it, and weighed upon it like thousands of hundredweights, dragging it rapidly down to the earth again; the strong wings of the eagles gave way, the wind roared round the prince's head, and the clouds around- were they formed by the smoke rising up from the burnt cities?- took strange shapes, like crabs many, many miles long, which stretched their claws out after him, and rose up like enormous rocks, from which rolling masses dashed down, and became fire-spitting dragons.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	The prince was lying half-dead in his ship, when it sank at last with a terrible shock into the branches of a large tree in the wood.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	And he spent seven years in the construction of wonderful ships to sail through the air, and had darts cast from the hardest steel to break the walls of heaven with.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	He gathered warriors from all countries, so many that when they were placed side by side they covered the space of several miles.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	They entered the ships and the prince was approaching his own, when God sent a swarm of gnats- one swarm of little gnats.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	Then he ordered his servants to bring costly coverings and wrap him in them, that the gnats might no longer be able to reach him.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	The servants carried out his orders, but one single gnat had placed itself inside one of the coverings, crept into the prince's ear and stung him.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	The place burnt like fire, and the poison entered into his blood.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	IN the high-road which led through a wood stood a solitary farm-house; the road, in fact, ran right through its yard.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	The sun was shining and all the windows were open; within the house people were very busy.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	In the yard, in an arbour formed by lilac bushes in full bloom, stood an open coffin; thither they had carried a dead man, who was to be buried that very afternoon.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	Nobody shed a tear over him; his face was covered over with a white cloth, under his head they had placed a large thick book, the leaves of which consisted of folded sheets of blotting-paper, and withered flowers lay between them; it was the herbarium which he had gathered in various places and was to be buried with him, according to his own wish.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	Every one of the flowers in it was connected with some chapter of his life.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	"The old student," was the reply.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	A swallow flew with the swiftness of an arrow into the arbour, turning in its flight, and twittered over the dead man's head.
disgust	fairytale_sentences	'Where the chimney smokes, the meal is being cooked,' says the proverb; but here a chimney smoked that devoured all the meals for the sake of gold.
disgust	fairytale_sentences	'Give it up, give it up!'
disgust	fairytale_sentences	But my Lord Daa would not do that.
disgust	fairytale_sentences	Daa and his daughters could not help hearing it, so I blew about their ears to drown the noise; what use was it that they should listen?
disgust	fairytale_sentences	What he thought was sufficiently expressed in his features and movements: "Miserable beggars, who are looking in, you are nothing in comparison to me."
disgust	fairytale_sentences	"Wicked Matz has become mad again!" they said amongst themselves.
disgust	fairytale_sentences	There lay fragments of plates, pieces of plaster, rags, old hats, and other rubbish not pleasant to see.
disgust	fairytale_sentences	"They are like wet wood," he would say, looking round to see what sort of people were present, "this evening; nothing fires them."
disgust	fairytale_sentences	No," replied Care; "you may depend upon it that whoever puts on those goloshes will be very unhappy, and bless the moment in which he can get rid of them."
disgust	fairytale_sentences	"What a scandalous condition this place is in," said he; never, certainly, had he found his own times so miserable as on this evening.
disgust	fairytale_sentences	The woman stared at him and shook her head.
surprise	fairytale_sentences	"Is it possible that I have been lying here in the street dreaming?" said he.
surprise	fairytale_sentences	It is quite shocking that one glass of punch should have upset me like this."
surprise	fairytale_sentences	"Well, I declare, there lies a pair of goloshes," said the watchman.
surprise	fairytale_sentences	"That was an ugly dream," said he, "but droll enough.
surprise	fairytale_sentences	"There goes one!" cried he.
surprise	fairytale_sentences	"I am too fat," he said; "I thought my head would be the worst, but I cannot get my body through, that is certain."
surprise	fairytale_sentences	I believe I am crazy already; oh, I wish I were free, then all these sensations would pass off."
surprise	fairytale_sentences	"Good gracious!" he sighed, "I must have a tendency to softening of the brain, and here it is so exceedingly hot that the blood is rushing to my head."
surprise	fairytale_sentences	"That is the cause of it all!" he exclaimed, "I must do something in time.
surprise	fairytale_sentences	"Ho!" he cried, jumping down and rushing towards the plunging bath.
disgust	fairytale_sentences	"They are strange people, these poets," thought the clerk.
surprise	fairytale_sentences	Dear me, how long it seems since I thought of those days!
surprise	fairytale_sentences	"Good gracious, what has come over me?
surprise	fairytale_sentences	What is this?- in my own handwriting, too!
surprise	fairytale_sentences	However did I get all this?
surprise	fairytale_sentences	And here is a letter!"
surprise	fairytale_sentences	"Well, now it is evident I must be dreaming; but I never had such a wild dream as this."
disgust	fairytale_sentences	You raise your naturally high notes so much, that you get covered over.
disgust	fairytale_sentences	They never serve me so.
surprise	fairytale_sentences	Fly out! they have forgotten to close the cage, and the window is open at the top.
surprise	fairytale_sentences	Fly, fly!"
surprise	fairytale_sentences	Grand, dark, and gloomy appeared the landscape around him.
disgust	fairytale_sentences	Wherever I go I feel a want which oppresses my heart, for something better presents itself at the moment; yes, something better, which shall be the best of all; but where is that to be found?
disgust	fairytale_sentences	"Look!" said Care; "what happiness have your goloshes brought to mankind?"
disgust	fairytale_sentences	"Not so," said Care, "he went away of himself, he was not summoned.
disgust	fairytale_sentences	Then he would wait no longer, but flew away, to commence his wooing at once.
disgust	fairytale_sentences	He next flew to the anemones; these were rather sour to his taste.
surprise	fairytale_sentences	He was just about to make her an offer, when, close by the maiden, he saw a pod, with a withered flower hanging at the end.
surprise	fairytale_sentences	"Oh, indeed; and you will be like her some day," said he; and he flew away directly, for he felt quite shocked.
disgust	fairytale_sentences	No; he did not like her.
disgust	fairytale_sentences	I am old, and you are old, but we may live for each other just the same; as to marrying- no; don't let us appear ridiculous at our age."
disgust	fairytale_sentences	"Ah," thought the butterfly, "one can't very well trust these plants in pots; they have too much to do with mankind."
disgust	fairytale_sentences	But the ball, which wore a dress of morocco leather, and thought as much of herself as any other young lady, would not even condescend to reply.
surprise	fairytale_sentences	But the ninth time it rose in the air, it remained away, and did not return.
surprise	fairytale_sentences	Oh dear, what a set of rabble I have got amongst!"
surprise	fairytale_sentences	"Thank goodness, here comes one of my own class, with whom I can talk," said the ball, examining the gilded top.
surprise	fairytale_sentences	"Ah," she exclaimed, "here is a gilt top."
surprise	fairytale_sentences	Never had she listened to such tones as these; they came from beyond a large dark curtain which separated the regions of death from the land of eternity.
surprise	fairytale_sentences	Then her husband asked, "From whence hast thou all at once derived such strength and comforting faith?"
disgust	fairytale_sentences	"Justice must still be carried out, even when one has relations and good friends among the prize committee; but that the snail should have received the second prize, I consider almost an insult to myself" "No," said the fence-rail, who had been a witness at the distribution of prizes; "there should be some consideration for industry and perseverance.
disgust	fairytale_sentences	You have no love of fatherland in you.
disgust	fairytale_sentences	"I know so much, at least, that the hare only ran from cowardice, and because he thought there was danger in delay.
disgust	fairytale_sentences	And the snail spat at them with contempt.
joy	fairytale_sentences	It seemed as if I saw myself again in the days of my childhood; and so I voted for the hare."
joy	fairytale_sentences	I call that conquering him; but I do not want the prize."
disgust	fairytale_sentences	Our worshipful judges don't appear to have noticed this at all.
disgust	fairytale_sentences	Were I the sunbeam, I would give each one of them a sun stroke; but that would only make them mad, and they are mad enough already.
joy	fairytale_sentences	It is glorious to bloom, to be fragrant, and to live; to live in story and in song.
surprise	fairytale_sentences	Hark, what a buzzing and humming there is!"
joy	fairytale_sentences	The elfin maidens we're already dancing on the elf hill, and they danced in shawls woven from moonshine and mist, which look very pretty to those who like such things.
surprise	fairytale_sentences	"They are coming! they are coming!" he cried.
joy	fairytale_sentences	"Give me my crown," said the elf king, "and let me stand in the moonshine."
surprise	fairytale_sentences	"Is that a hill?" said the youngest of the boys, pointing to the elf hill, "we should call it a hole in Norway."
disgust	fairytale_sentences	Can they do anything more than dance and throw about their legs, and make a whirlwind?"
disgust	fairytale_sentences	But the old goblin said he should not like his wife to have such an accomplishment, and thought his boys would have the same objection.
joy	fairytale_sentences	"She will make a good housewife," said the old goblin, and then saluted her with his eyes instead of drinking her health; for he did not drink much.
disgust	fairytale_sentences	"That is a dangerous woman," said the old goblin; and the two sons walked out of the hill; they had had enough of it.
surprise	fairytale_sentences	"Ho! ho!" said the old goblin, "is that what she means?
joy	fairytale_sentences	So she took him by the wrist, and he laughed till he nearly choked; and when she came to the fourth finger, there was a gold ring on it, as if it knew there was to be a betrothal.
joy	fairytale_sentences	Then the old goblin said, "Hold fast what you have: this hand is yours; for I will have you for a wife myself."
joy	fairytale_sentences	How merry we shall be!
joy	fairytale_sentences	It is indeed very pleasant to live in old Norway.
joy	fairytale_sentences	But the old goblin danced about the room with his young bride, and exchanged boots with her, which is more fashionable than exchanging rings.
joy	fairytale_sentences	But the lizards continued to run up and down the riven tree; and one said to the other, "Oh, how much I was pleased with the old goblin!"
joy	fairytale_sentences	The great white snails, which grand people in olden times used to have made into fricassees; and when they had eaten them, they would say, "O, what a delicious dish!" for these people really thought them good; and these snails lived on burdock-leaves, and for them the burdock was planted.
joy	fairytale_sentences	They lived quite retired and very happily; and as they had no children of their own, they had adopted a little common snail, which they brought up as their own child.
surprise	fairytale_sentences	"Listen, what a drumming there is on the burdock-leaves; turn, turn, turn; turn, turn, turn," said the father-snail.
joy	fairytale_sentences	"There come the drops," said the mother; "they are trickling down the stalks.
joy	fairytale_sentences	We shall have it very wet here presently.
joy	fairytale_sentences	I am very glad we have such good houses, and that the little one has one of his own.
joy	fairytale_sentences	There has been really more done for us than for any other creature; it is quite plain that we are the most noble people in the world.
joy	fairytale_sentences	"There can be nothing better than we have here," said the father-snail; "I wish for nothing more."
disgust	fairytale_sentences	You need not be in a hurry; you are always so impatient, and the youngster is getting just the same.
joy	fairytale_sentences	He will be the joy of our home; and we old folks have nothing else to live for.
disgust	fairytale_sentences	"There may be black snails, no doubt," said the old snail; "black snails without houses; but they are so vulgar and conceited too.
joy	fairytale_sentences	"She has a palace," replied the ant,- "a most beautiful ant-palace with seven hundred passages."
disgust	fairytale_sentences	"He has the whole burdock forest; she has only a bush."
joy	fairytale_sentences	But a beautiful speech was made by the mother-snail.
joy	fairytale_sentences	The father could not speak; he was too much overcome.
joy	fairytale_sentences	Then they gave the whole burdock forest to the young snails as an inheritance, and repeated what they had so often said, that it was the finest place in the world, and that if they led upright and honorable lives, and their family increased, they and their children might some day be taken to the nobleman's palace, to be boiled black, and laid on a silver dish.
joy	fairytale_sentences	And the rain fell upon the burdock-leaves, to play the drum for them, and the sun shone to paint colors on the burdock forest for them, and they were very happy; the whole family were entirely and perfectly happy.
disgust	fairytale_sentences	Karen believed that this was all on account of the red shoes, but the old lady thought them hideous, and so they were burnt.
joy	fairytale_sentences	"Yes, they do shine," said Karen.
surprise	fairytale_sentences	She said that it was a shocking thing to do, that it was very improper, and that Karen was always to go to church in future in black shoes, even if they were old.
surprise	fairytale_sentences	"Dear me, what pretty dancing-shoes!" said the soldier.
joy	fairytale_sentences	"Sit fast, when you dance," said he, addressing the shoes, and slapping the soles with his hand.
surprise	fairytale_sentences	But it was the old soldier with the red beard; he sat there nodding his head and said: "Dear me, what pretty dancing shoes!"
disgust	fairytale_sentences	"Dance you shall," said he, "dance in your red shoes till you are pale and cold, till your skin shrivels up and you are a skeleton!
disgust	fairytale_sentences	Dance you shall, from door to door, and where proud and wicked children live you shall knock, so that they may hear you and fear you!
disgust	fairytale_sentences	Dance you shall, dance- !"
joy	fairytale_sentences	And he carved her a pair of wooden feet and some crutches, and taught her a psalm which is always sung by sinners; she kissed the hand that guided the axe, and went away over the heath.
joy	fairytale_sentences	"It was mercy," said she.
joy	fairytale_sentences	The bright warm sunshine streamed through the window into the pew where Karen sat, and her heart became so filled with it, so filled with peace and joy, that it broke.
joy	fairytale_sentences	Her soul flew on the sunbeams to Heaven, and no one was there who asked after the Red Shoes.
joy	fairytale_sentences	And the old grandfather nodded again; and the more he looked at Holger Danske, the more satisfied he felt that he had carved a good image of him.
joy	fairytale_sentences	"That is the most beautiful coat of arms in the world," said the old man.
joy	fairytale_sentences	And the third flame led him to Greenland's wretched huts, where the preacher, Hans Egede, ruled with love in every word and action.
surprise	fairytale_sentences	"What you have been carving is very beautiful, grandfather," said she.
joy	fairytale_sentences	I was on board the Denmark, in Steene Bille's squadron; I had a man by my side whom even the cannon balls seemed to fear.
joy	fairytale_sentences	He sung old songs in a merry voice, and fired and fought as if he were something more than a man.
joy	fairytale_sentences	Then the daughter-in-law kissed the old grandfather, and led him to a large arm-chair by the table; and she, and her husband, who was the son of the old man and the father of the little boy who lay in bed, sat down to supper with him.
joy	fairytale_sentences	Holger Danske can appear in marble, so that people in all countries of the world may hear of the strength of Denmark.
joy	fairytale_sentences	Now let us drink the health of Bertel."
joy	fairytale_sentences	And Holger Danske did dream of the little humble room in which the image-carver sat; he heard all that had been said, and he nodded in his dream, saying, "Ah, yes, remember me, you Danish people, keep me in your memory, I will come to you in the hour of need."
disgust	fairytale_sentences	"What has a woman to do with rule?" said the bishop.
disgust	fairytale_sentences	"Cursed be she and all that belongs to her.
joy	fairytale_sentences	He seized her hand, he embraced her, and the mother wept.
disgust	fairytale_sentences	"That will avail him little," said the bishop.
surprise	fairytale_sentences	"Sayest thou so?" replied Olaf Hase.
surprise	fairytale_sentences	"Hold, brother!
joy	fairytale_sentences	They will have no word more to say in the matter, nor will I speak again of all the wrong that my mother has endured."
joy	fairytale_sentences	Then their anxieties are dispelled; and at even they join in the dance at the feast given in the great hall at Borglum.
surprise	fairytale_sentences	"What a ridiculous little shoot!" said one.
disgust	fairytale_sentences	"It must be a kind of garden plant," said another; and so they sneered and despised the plant as a thing from a garden.
surprise	fairytale_sentences	When spring came, the plant appeared in full bloom: a more beautiful object than any other plant in the forest.
surprise	fairytale_sentences	"It must be some degenerate species," said he; "I do not know it, and it is not mentioned in any system."
disgust	fairytale_sentences	"Not known in any system!" repeated the thistles and the nettles.
joy	fairytale_sentences	"They imagined evil in their hearts, but God turned it to good."
joy	fairytale_sentences	The girl stood still before the wonderful plant, for the green leaves exhaled a sweet and refreshing fragrance, and the flowers glittered and sparkled in the sunshine like colored flames, and the harmony of sweet sounds lingered round them as if each concealed within itself a deep fount of melody, which thousands of years could not exhaust.
joy	fairytale_sentences	With pious gratitude the girl looked upon this glorious work of God, and bent down over one of the branches, that she might examine the flower and inhale the sweet perfume.
joy	fairytale_sentences	Then a light broke in on her mind, and her heart expanded.
surprise	fairytale_sentences	She knew it would so soon fade; so she took only a single green leaf, carried it home, and laid it in her Bible, where it remained ever green, fresh, and unfading.
surprise	fairytale_sentences	Between the pages of the Bible it still lay when, a few weeks afterwards, that Bible was laid under the young girl's head in her coffin.
joy	fairytale_sentences	In the forest the wonderful plant still continued to bloom till it grew and became almost a tree, and all the birds of passage bowed themselves before it.
disgust	fairytale_sentences	"That plant is a foreigner, no doubt," said the thistles and the burdocks.
disgust	fairytale_sentences	"We can never conduct ourselves like that in this country."
disgust	fairytale_sentences	And the black forest snails actually spat at the flower.
surprise	fairytale_sentences	He pulled up the wonderful plant, roots and all, and placed it in his bundle.
surprise	fairytale_sentences	"You did not know, any better!
joy	fairytale_sentences	The botanical professor wrote a long treatise about the heavenly plant, and for this he was loaded with gold, which improved the position of himself and his family.
surprise	fairytale_sentences	He still lay thinking and thinking, when all at once it seemed as if some one kissed him on his eyes and mouth.
joy	fairytale_sentences	He was very proud, and said, "Thorwalsden lived close to me, and here I am now, quite comfortable."
surprise	fairytale_sentences	But now little Tuk was no longer in bed; all in a moment he found himself on horseback.
joy	fairytale_sentences	Within there were songs and dancing; King Waldemar and the young gayly-dressed ladies of the court were dancing together.
surprise	fairytale_sentences	One tower after another fell, till at last only one remained standing on the hill where the castle had formerly been.
joy	fairytale_sentences	But I am fragrant with perfume, for close to my gates most lovely roses bloom."
surprise	fairytale_sentences	All at once everything vanished; but where!
surprise	fairytale_sentences	"Yes, that it has," said she, and then, just as she was going to tell him a great many pretty stories from Holberg's comedies, and about Waldemar and Absalom, she suddenly shrunk up together, and wagged her head as if she were a frog about to spring.
surprise	fairytale_sentences	Then little Tuk saw she was changed into a frog.
joy	fairytale_sentences	How it sounded like the cry of the frogs on the moor, or like the creaking of great boots when some one is marching,- always the same tone, so monotonous and wearing, that little Tuk at length fell fast asleep, and then the sound could not annoy him.
joy	fairytale_sentences	The bird of good omen shall be yours, and you shall become a rich and happy man; your house shall rise up like King Waldemar's towers, and shall be richly adorned with marble statues, like those at Prastoe.
joy	fairytale_sentences	Understand me well; your name shall travel with fame round the world like the ship that was to sail from Corsor, and at Roeskilde,- Don't forget the names of the towns, as King Hroar said,- you shall speak well and clearly little Tuk, and when at last you lie in your grave you shall sleep peacefully, as-" "As if I lay in Soroe," said little Tuk awaking.
joy	fairytale_sentences	The old washerwoman put her head in at the door, and nodded to him quite kindly, and said, "Many thanks, you good child, for your help yesterday.
joy	fairytale_sentences	I hope all your beautiful dreams will come true."
joy	fairytale_sentences	It was really a wonderful light.
joy	fairytale_sentences	It seemed to the little girl that she was sitting by a large iron stove, with polished brass feet and a brass ornament.
surprise	fairytale_sentences	How the fire burned! and seemed so beautifully warm that the child stretched out her feet as if to warm them, when, lo! the flame of the match went out, the stove vanished, and she had only the remains of the half-burnt match in her hand.
joy	fairytale_sentences	She lighted another match, and then she found herself sitting under a beautiful Christmas-tree.
surprise	fairytale_sentences	The little one stretched out her hand towards them, and the match went out.
joy	fairytale_sentences	She again rubbed a match on the wall, and the light shone round her; in the brightness stood her old grandmother, clear and shining, yet mild and loving in her appearance.
joy	fairytale_sentences	And the matches glowed with a light that was brighter than the noon-day, and her grandmother had never appeared so large or so beautiful.
joy	fairytale_sentences	She took the little girl in her arms, and they both flew upwards in brightness and joy far above the earth, where there was neither cold nor hunger nor pain, for they were with God.
surprise	fairytale_sentences	In the dawn of morning there lay the poor little one, with pale cheeks and smiling mouth, leaning against the wall; she had been frozen to death on the last evening of the year; and the New-year's sun rose and shone upon a little corpse!
joy	fairytale_sentences	It did not mind that nobody saw it in the grass, and that it was a poor despised flower; on the contrary, it was quite happy, and turned towards the sun, looking upward and listening to the song of the lark high up in the air.
joy	fairytale_sentences	The little daisy was as happy as if the day had been a great holiday, but it was only Monday.
joy	fairytale_sentences	All the children were at school, and while they were sitting on the forms and learning their lessons, it sat on its thin green stalk and learnt from the sun and from its surroundings how kind God is, and it rejoiced that the song of the little lark expressed so sweetly and distinctly its own feelings.
joy	fairytale_sentences	"I can see and hear," it thought; "the sun shines upon me, and the forest kisses me.
joy	fairytale_sentences	How rich I am!"
joy	fairytale_sentences	Thank God, that I stand so near and can at least see all the splendour."
joy	fairytale_sentences	Its joy was so great that it did not know what to think.
joy	fairytale_sentences	The little bird hopped round it and sang, "How beautifully soft the grass is, and what a lovely little flower with its golden heart and silver dress is growing here."
joy	fairytale_sentences	How happy the daisy was!
joy	fairytale_sentences	Half ashamed, yet glad at heart, it looked over to the other flowers in the garden; surely they had witnessed its pleasure and the honour that had been done to it; they understood its joy.
surprise	fairytale_sentences	"Ugh!" sighed the daisy, "that is terrible; now they are done for."
joy	fairytale_sentences	The daisy was glad that it was outside, and only a small flower- it felt very grateful.
disgust	fairytale_sentences	THAT was a terrible affair!" said a hen, and in a quarter of the town, too, where it had not taken place.
disgust	fairytale_sentences	"That was a terrible affair in a hen-roost.
joy	fairytale_sentences	"There it goes," she said; "the more I pluck, the more beautiful do I get."
joy	fairytale_sentences	She said this merrily, for she was the best of the hens, and, moreover, as had been said, very respectable.
joy	fairytale_sentences	It was dark all around, and hen sat close to hen, but the one who sat nearest to her merry neighbour did not sleep.
surprise	fairytale_sentences	"Did you hear what was said?
disgust	fairytale_sentences	I mention no names, but there is a hen here who intends to pluck herself in order to look well.
disgust	fairytale_sentences	If I were a cock, I should despise her."
disgust	fairytale_sentences	They rolled their eyes, and mother owl, beating her wings, said: "Don't listen to her!
disgust	fairytale_sentences	There is one among the fowls who has so far forgotten what is becoming to a hen that she plucks out all her feathers and lets the cock see it."
surprise	fairytale_sentences	"Where? where?" cooed the doves.
disgust	fairytale_sentences	It is almost unbecoming to tell the story, but there is no doubt about it."
disgust	fairytale_sentences	It is a dangerous game, for one can easily catch cold and die from fever, and both of these are dead already."
surprise	fairytale_sentences	They had plucked out all their feathers.
disgust	fairytale_sentences	It is a horrible story: I will not keep it to myself, but let it go farther."
disgust	fairytale_sentences	The hen who had lost the loose little feather naturally did not recognise her own story, and being a respectable hen, said: "I despise those fowls; but there are more of that kind.
joy	fairytale_sentences	The maids often laid the clean copper saucepans and kitchen vessels on this stone, that they might dry in the sun, and the children were fond of playing on it.
surprise	fairytale_sentences	"Dear me! how singular.
surprise	fairytale_sentences	Why that must be the grave-stone of Preben Schwane and his wife."
joy	fairytale_sentences	Preben and Martha were a fine old couple, and when they both sat on the bench, at the top of the steep stone steps, in front of their house, with the branches of the linden-tree waving above them, and nodded in a gentle, friendly way to passers by, it really made one feel quite happy.
joy	fairytale_sentences	And then he talked of his wedding-day; and his eyes brightened, and he seemed to be carried back, by his words, to that joyful time.
joy	fairytale_sentences	All that the boy had heard of Old Preben and his wife seemed clearly defined on the stone, and as he gazed on it, and glanced at the clear, bright moon shining in the pure air, it was as if the light of God's countenance beamed over His beautiful world.
surprise	fairytale_sentences	"Forgotten!
joy	fairytale_sentences	The old pair shall again wander through the streets arm-in-arm, or sit with their fresh, healthy cheeks on the bench under the lime-tree, and smile and nod at rich and poor.
joy	fairytale_sentences	She specially loved roses, and therefore she possessed the most beautiful varieties of this flower, from the wild hedge-rose, with its apple-scented leaves, to the splendid Provence rose.
sadness	fairytale_sentences	"No one has yet named the flower," said the wise man.
sadness	fairytale_sentences	"No one has pointed out the spot where it blooms in all its splendor.
joy	fairytale_sentences	"I know where it blooms," said a happy mother, who came with her lovely child to the bedside of the queen.
joy	fairytale_sentences	"I know where the loveliest rose in the world is.
joy	fairytale_sentences	It is seen on the blooming cheeks of my sweet child, when it expresses the pure and holy love of infancy; when refreshed by sleep it opens its eyes, and smiles upon me with childlike affection."
sadness	fairytale_sentences	She wept over it, kissed it, and prayed for it as only a mother can pray in that hour of her anguish."
joy	fairytale_sentences	"May she be blessed!" said the wise man: "but no one has yet named the loveliest rose in the world."
sadness	fairytale_sentences	Tears stood in his eyes, and glistened on his cheeks; he carried a great book and the binding was of velvet, with silver clasps.
sadness	fairytale_sentences	"Mother," cried the little boy; "only hear what I have read."
joy	fairytale_sentences	He read, "Greater love hath no man than this," and as he read a roseate hue spread over the cheeks of the queen, and her eyes became so enlightened and clear, that she saw from the leaves of the book a lovely rose spring forth, a type of Him who shed His blood on the cross.
joy	fairytale_sentences	"I see it," she said.
joy	fairytale_sentences	They looked at Little Claus ploughing with his five horses, and he was so proud that he smacked his whip, and said, "Gee-up, my five horses."
disgust	fairytale_sentences	"You must not say that," said Big Claus; "for only one of them belongs to you."
disgust	fairytale_sentences	"Now I must beg you not to say that again," said Big Claus; "for if you do, I shall hit your horse on the head, so that he will drop dead on the spot, and there will be an end of him."
joy	fairytale_sentences	"I promise you I will not say it any more," said the other; but as soon as people came by, nodding to him, and wishing him "Good day," he became so pleased, and thought how grand it looked to have five horses ploughing in his field, that he cried out again, "Gee-up, all my horses!"
surprise	fairytale_sentences	"I'll gee-up your horses for you," said Big Claus; and seizing a hammer, he struck the one horse of Little Claus on the head, and he fell dead instantly.
sadness	fairytale_sentences	"Oh, now I have no horse at all, said Little Claus, weeping.
sadness	fairytale_sentences	"Then I shall be obliged to lie out here," said Little Claus to himself, as the farmer's wife shut the door in his face.
joy	fairytale_sentences	The farmer's wife and the sexton were sitting at the table together; and she filled his glass, and helped him plenteously to fish, which appeared to be his favorite dish.
sadness	fairytale_sentences	"Oh, dear," sighed Little Claus from the top of the shed, as he saw all the good things disappear.
surprise	fairytale_sentences	"Is any one up there?" asked the farmer, looking up and discovering Little Claus.
surprise	fairytale_sentences	"Why are you lying up there?
joy	fairytale_sentences	The woman received them both very kindly, laid the cloth on a large table, and placed before them a dish of porridge.
sadness	fairytale_sentences	Now Little Claus did not relish the porridge at all, so he trod with his foot on the sack under the table, and the dry skin squeaked quite loud.
surprise	fairytale_sentences	"Hallo! what have you got in your sack!" asked the farmer.
surprise	fairytale_sentences	"Wonderful!" cried the farmer, starting up and opening the oven door; and there lay all the nice things hidden by the farmer's wife, but which he supposed had been conjured there by the wizard under the table.
joy	fairytale_sentences	So the woman was obliged to bring out the wine also, which she had hidden, and the farmer drank it till he became quite merry.
joy	fairytale_sentences	"I should like to see him now, while I am so merry."
joy	fairytale_sentences	"Oh, I am not afraid.
surprise	fairytale_sentences	"Oh," cried he, springing backwards, "I saw him, and he is exactly like our sexton.
disgust	fairytale_sentences	I would not have it in the house another hour; there is no knowing if he may not be still there."
joy	fairytale_sentences	"I have been well paid for my horse," said he to himself when he reached home, entered his own room, and emptied all his money into a heap on the floor.
disgust	fairytale_sentences	"What can he want it for?" thought Great Claus; so he smeared the bottom of the measure with tar, that some of whatever was put into it might stick there and remain.
surprise	fairytale_sentences	"Are you mad?" they all cried; "do you think we have money to spend by the bushel?"
sadness	fairytale_sentences	She had been cross, unkind, and really spiteful to him; but he was very sorry, and took the dead woman and laid her in his warm bed to see if he could bring her to life again.
surprise	fairytale_sentences	"That is a very wicked man," thought Little Claus; "he meant to kill me.
surprise	fairytale_sentences	Hallo!" cried Little Claus, rushing out of the door, and seizing hold of the landlord by the throat; "you have killed my grandmother; see, here is a great hole in her forehead."
surprise	fairytale_sentences	"Oh, how unfortunate," said the landlord, wringing his hands.
disgust	fairytale_sentences	"This all comes of my fiery temper.
surprise	fairytale_sentences	"How is this?" thought Great Claus; "did I not kill him?
surprise	fairytale_sentences	"How did you get all this money?" asked Great Claus, staring with wide open eyes at his neighbor's treasures.
surprise	fairytale_sentences	"Heaven preserve us!" cried the apothecary, "you are out of your mind.
disgust	fairytale_sentences	Don't say such things, or you will lose your head."
disgust	fairytale_sentences	And then he talked to him seriously about the wicked deed he had done, and told him that such a wicked man would surely be punished.
sadness	fairytale_sentences	"And I, poor fellow," said the drover, "I who am so old already, cannot get there."
joy	fairytale_sentences	"With all my heart," replied the drover, opening the sack, from which sprung Little Claus as quickly as possible.
surprise	fairytale_sentences	"How light he seems now," said he.
joy	fairytale_sentences	"Ah, it is because I have been to a church."
joy	fairytale_sentences	"There you may lie!" he exclaimed; "you will play me no more tricks now."
surprise	fairytale_sentences	"How is this?" said Great Claus.
surprise	fairytale_sentences	"Did I not drown you just now?"
joy	fairytale_sentences	"I'll tell you the whole story, and thank you for drowning me; I am above you now, I am really very rich.
surprise	fairytale_sentences	"What a lucky fellow you are!" exclaimed Great Claus.
joy	fairytale_sentences	However if you will go there first, and then creep into a sack, I will throw you in with the greatest pleasure."
joy	fairytale_sentences	"Thank you," said Great Claus; "but remember, if I do not get any sea-cattle down there I shall come up again and give you a good thrashing."
joy	fairytale_sentences	The first thing in the world they ever heard were the words, "Tin soldiers!" uttered by a little boy, who clapped his hands with delight when the lid of the box, in which they lay, was taken off.
joy	fairytale_sentences	Still I must try and make her acquaintance."
joy	fairytale_sentences	The nut-crackers played at leap-frog, and the pencil jumped about the table.
disgust	fairytale_sentences	"Very well; wait till to-morrow, then," said the goblin.
surprise	fairytale_sentences	When it was over, two boys happened to pass by, and one of them said, "Look, there is a tin soldier.
joy	fairytale_sentences	So they made a boat out of a newspaper, and placed the tin soldier in it, and sent him sailing down the gutter, while the two boys ran by the side of it, and clapped their hands.
joy	fairytale_sentences	It touched the tin soldier so much to see her that he almost wept tin tears, but he kept them back.
joy	fairytale_sentences	During the whole day he enjoyed himself in the warm sunshine, flew from flower to flower, and danced on the wings of the flying butterflies.
surprise	fairytale_sentences	He flew thither; but "hush!" two people were in the arbor,- a handsome young man and a beautiful lady.
sadness	fairytale_sentences	"But we must part," said the young man; "your brother does not like our engagement, and therefore he sends me so far away on business, over mountains and seas.
sadness	fairytale_sentences	Farewell, my sweet bride; for so you are to me."
sadness	fairytale_sentences	And then they kissed each other, and the girl wept, and gave him a rose; but before she did so, she pressed a kiss upon it so fervently that the flower opened.
joy	fairytale_sentences	Her wicked brother stopped over her, and laughed hideously, as fiends only can laugh.
sadness	fairytale_sentences	Oh, what bitter tears she shed! and she could not open her heart to any one for relief.
joy	fairytale_sentences	Her brother often came into the room, and would be quite cheerful, in spite of his base conduct; so she dare not say a word to him of her heart's grief.
sadness	fairytale_sentences	Oh, how she wept and prayed that she also might die!
sadness	fairytale_sentences	"I will keep this," said she; and as soon as she had covered the body again with the earth and leaves, she took the head and a little sprig of jasmine that bloomed in the wood, near the spot where he was buried, and carried them home with her.
sadness	fairytale_sentences	"Alas! how soon all that is good and beautiful passes away," sighed the elf.
sadness	fairytale_sentences	Every morning he flew to the window of the poor girl, and always found her weeping by the flower pot.
sadness	fairytale_sentences	The bitter tears fell upon the jasmine twig, and each day, as she became paler and paler, the sprig appeared to grow greener and fresher.
joy	fairytale_sentences	Sweetly she dreamed, and while she dreamt, her life passed away calmly and gently, and her spirit was with him whom she loved, in heaven.
sadness	fairytale_sentences	And the jasmine opened its large white bells, and spread forth its sweet fragrance; it had no other way of showing its grief for the dead.
disgust	fairytale_sentences	And the bees told it to their queen, who commanded that the next morning they should go and kill the murderer.
joy	fairytale_sentences	"Now have we revenged the dead," said they, and flew back into the white bells of the jasmine flowers.
joy	fairytale_sentences	And the queen bee hummed in the air, and sang of the revenge of the flowers, and of the elf of the rose and said that behind the smallest leaf dwells One, who can discover evil deeds, and punish them also.
joy	fairytale_sentences	"Thank you, old witch," said the soldier.
joy	fairytale_sentences	"Very well; I promise.
sadness	fairytale_sentences	No one but the king himself can pass in or out, for there has been a prophecy that she will marry a common soldier, and the king cannot bear to think of such a marriage."
joy	fairytale_sentences	However, he passed a very pleasant time; went to the theatre, drove in the king's garden, and gave a great deal of money to the poor, which was very good of him; he remembered what it had been in olden times to be without a shilling.
joy	fairytale_sentences	Now he was rich, had fine clothes, and many friends, who all declared he was a fine fellow and a real gentleman, and all this gratified him exceedingly.
joy	fairytale_sentences	"Hallo," said the soldier; "well this is a pleasant tinderbox, if it brings me all I wish for."
sadness	fairytale_sentences	The soldier longed very much to see the princess once more, so he sent for the dog again in the night to fetch her, and to run with her as fast as ever he could.
joy	fairytale_sentences	During the night, the dog came again and carried the princess on his back, and ran with her to the soldier, who loved her very much, and wished that he had been a prince, so that he might have her for a wife.
sadness	fairytale_sentences	Oh, how dark and disagreeable it was as he sat there, and the people said to him, "To-morrow you will be hanged."
joy	fairytale_sentences	The shoemaker's boy liked the idea of getting the four shillings, so he ran very fast and fetched the tinder-box, and gave it to the soldier.
disgust	fairytale_sentences	"I will not be touched," said the king.
joy	fairytale_sentences	The princess came out of the copper castle, and became queen, which was very pleasing to her.
joy	fairytale_sentences	Corn grows in the surrounding fields, not only rye and barley, but oats,-pretty oats that, when ripe, look like a number of little golden canary-birds sitting on a bough.
joy	fairytale_sentences	The corn has a smiling look and the heaviest and richest ears bend their heads low as if in pious humility.
joy	fairytale_sentences	The buckwheat did not bend like the other grain, but erected its head proudly and stiffly on the stem.
joy	fairytale_sentences	"I am as valuable as any other corn," said he, "and I am much handsomer; my flowers are as beautiful as the bloom of the apple blossom, and it is a pleasure to look at us.
joy	fairytale_sentences	Do you know of anything prettier than we are, you old willow-tree?"
joy	fairytale_sentences	Proudly and boldly he looked up, while the lightning flashed across the sky as if the whole world were in flames.
sadness	fairytale_sentences	When the dreadful storm had passed, the flowers and the corn raised their drooping heads in the pure still air, refreshed by the rain, but the buckwheat lay like a weed in the field, burnt to blackness by the lightning.
sadness	fairytale_sentences	The branches of the old willow-tree rustled in the wind, and large water-drops fell from his green leaves as if the old willow were weeping.
joy	fairytale_sentences	"See," they said, how the sun shines, and the clouds float in the blue sky.
sadness	fairytale_sentences	Then the willow told them of the haughty pride of the buckwheat, and of the punishment which followed in consequence.
joy	fairytale_sentences	"I shall win the Princess!"
joy	fairytale_sentences	If she accepts me, she accepts me; and if she won't have me, I'll have her; but she shall be mine!"
disgust	fairytale_sentences	"Don't talk nonsense," replied the old gentleman.
disgust	fairytale_sentences	"You shall have no horse from me.
disgust	fairytale_sentences	You don't know how to speak- you can't arrange your words.
joy	fairytale_sentences	"Hei, houp! that was a ride!
joy	fairytale_sentences	Here I come!" shouted Jack the Dullard, and he sang till his voice echoed far and wide.
joy	fairytale_sentences	"Hallo!" shouted Jack the Dullard.
joy	fairytale_sentences	"Here am I!
joy	fairytale_sentences	"With the crow? why, I am going to give it to the Princess."
disgust	fairytale_sentences	"Dullard!" they cried, "that is only an old wooden shoe, and the upper part is missing into the bargain; are you going to give that also to the Princess?"
joy	fairytale_sentences	"Hurrah! it is quite famous."
joy	fairytale_sentences	"Oh," said Jack the Dullard, "I can hardly tell you.
joy	fairytale_sentences	How glad the Princess will be!"
disgust	fairytale_sentences	"Bah!" said the brothers; "that is nothing but clay out of the ditch."
joy	fairytale_sentences	"Yes, certainly it is," said Jack the Dullard; "and clay of the finest sort.
joy	fairytale_sentences	See, it is so wet, it runs through one's fingers."
disgust	fairytale_sentences	Then the Princess would say, "He is of no use!
disgust	fairytale_sentences	Away with him out of the hall!"
disgust	fairytale_sentences	"He is of no use!" said the Princess.
disgust	fairytale_sentences	"Away with him!"
disgust	fairytale_sentences	"Away with him!"
joy	fairytale_sentences	"Ah, that's lucky!" exclaimed Jack the Dullard, "for I suppose you'll let me roast my crow at the same time?"
joy	fairytale_sentences	"With the greatest pleasure," said the Princess.
joy	fairytale_sentences	"Certainly I have!" said Jack.
joy	fairytale_sentences	"Well, that is a famous dish!" said the Princess.
joy	fairytale_sentences	"I like that!" said the Princess.
joy	fairytale_sentences	"You can give an answer, and you have something to say for yourself, and so you shall be my husband.
joy	fairytale_sentences	But she only said this to frighten Jack the Dullard; and the clerks gave a great crow of delight, and each one spurted a blot out of his pen on to the floor.
joy	fairytale_sentences	"That was very cleverly done," observed the Princess.
joy	fairytale_sentences	The branch well knew how beautiful it was; this knowledge exists as much in the leaf as in the blood; I was therefore not surprised when a nobleman's carriage, in which sat the young countess, stopped in the road just by.
joy	fairytale_sentences	She said that an apple-branch was a most lovely object, and an emblem of spring in its most charming aspect.
disgust	fairytale_sentences	"Poor, despised herbs," said the apple-branch; "there is really a difference between them and such as I am.
sadness	fairytale_sentences	And the apple-branch looked with a sort of pity upon them, especially on a certain little flower that is found in fields and in ditches.
disgust	fairytale_sentences	"You do not see very far, nor very clearly," he said to the apple-branch.
disgust	fairytale_sentences	"Which is the despised plant you so specially pity?"
disgust	fairytale_sentences	"No one ever places it in a nosegay; it is often trodden under foot, there are so many of them; and when they run to seed, they have flowers like wool, which fly away in little pieces over the roads, and cling to the dresses of the people.
disgust	fairytale_sentences	They are only weeds; but of course there must be weeds.
joy	fairytale_sentences	O, I am really very thankful that I was not made like one of these flowers."
joy	fairytale_sentences	There came presently across the fields a whole group of children, the youngest of whom was so small that it had to be carried by the others; and when he was seated on the grass, among the yellow flowers, he laughed aloud with joy, kicked out his little legs, rolled about, plucked the yellow flowers, and kissed them in childlike innocence.
joy	fairytale_sentences	"Do you see," said the sunbeam, "do you see the beauty of these flowers? do you see their powers of giving pleasure?"
joy	fairytale_sentences	"See," she exclaimed, "how wonderfully God has made this little flower.
joy	fairytale_sentences	I will paint it with the apple-branch together.
sadness	fairytale_sentences	FAR down in the forest, where the warm sun and the fresh air made a sweet resting-place, grew a pretty little fir-tree; and yet it was not happy, it wished so much to be tall like its companions- the pines and firs which grew around it.
joy	fairytale_sentences	The sun shone, and the soft air fluttered its leaves, and the little peasant children passed by, prattling merrily, but the fir-tree heeded them not.
sadness	fairytale_sentences	Sometimes the children would bring a large basket of raspberries or strawberries, wreathed on a straw, and seat themselves near the fir-tree, and say, "Is it not a pretty little tree?" which made it feel more unhappy than before.
sadness	fairytale_sentences	Still, as it grew, it complained, "Oh! how I wish I were as tall as the other trees, then I would spread out my branches on every side, and my top would over-look the wide world.
sadness	fairytale_sentences	The tree was so discontented, that it took no pleasure in the warm sunshine, the birds, or the rosy clouds that floated over it morning and evening.
sadness	fairytale_sentences	Yet it remained unsatisfied, and would exclaim, "Oh, if I could but keep on growing tall and old!
sadness	fairytale_sentences	There is nothing else worth caring for in the world!"
sadness	fairytale_sentences	"Oh, how I wish I were tall enough to go on the sea," said the fir-tree.
joy	fairytale_sentences	They are dressed up in the most splendid manner.
sadness	fairytale_sentences	I long for it almost with pain.
sadness	fairytale_sentences	Oh! when will Christmas be here?
joy	fairytale_sentences	Yes, what follows will be grander and more splendid.
sadness	fairytale_sentences	I am weary with longing.
joy	fairytale_sentences	"Rejoice with us," said the air and the sunlight.
joy	fairytale_sentences	"Enjoy thine own bright life in the fresh air."
sadness	fairytale_sentences	As the axe cut through the stem, and divided the pith, the tree fell with a groan to the earth, conscious of pain and faintness, and forgetting all its anticipations of happiness, in sorrow at leaving its home in the forest.
sadness	fairytale_sentences	It knew that it should never again see its dear old companions, the trees, nor the little bushes and many-colored flowers that had grown by its side; perhaps not even the birds.
joy	fairytale_sentences	Oh, it was very beautiful!
joy	fairytale_sentences	"This evening," they all exclaimed, "how bright it will be!"
joy	fairytale_sentences	"Oh, that the evening were come," thought the tree, "and the tapers lighted! then I shall know what else is going to happen.
joy	fairytale_sentences	It trembled so with joy in all its branches, that one of the candles fell among the green leaves and burnt some of them.
joy	fairytale_sentences	For a moment the little ones stood silent with astonishment, and then they shouted for joy, till the room rang, and they danced merrily round the tree, while one present after another was taken from it.
joy	fairytale_sentences	The children then danced about with their pretty toys, and no one noticed the tree, except the children's maid who came and peeped among the branches to see if an apple or a fig had been forgotten.
joy	fairytale_sentences	"A story, a story," cried the children, pulling a little fat man towards the tree.
joy	fairytale_sentences	And the children clapped their hands and cried, "Tell another, tell another," for they wanted to hear the story of "Ivede-Avede;" but they only had "Humpty Dumpty."
joy	fairytale_sentences	"Ah! yes, so it happens in the world," thought the fir-tree; he believed it all, because it was related by such a nice man.
joy	fairytale_sentences	"Ah! well," he thought, "who knows? perhaps I may fall down too, and marry a princess;" and he looked forward joyfully to the next evening, expecting to be again decked out with lights and playthings, gold and fruit.
joy	fairytale_sentences	"Now," thought the fir, "all my splendor is going to begin again."
sadness	fairytale_sentences	Still I wish this place were not so dark, as well as lonely, with not even a little hare to look at.
sadness	fairytale_sentences	Oh! it is terrible lonely here."
joy	fairytale_sentences	"Happy!" exclaimed the fir-tree, and then as he reflected upon what he had been telling them, he said, "Ah, yes! after all those were happy days."
joy	fairytale_sentences	But when he went on and related all about Christmas-eve, and how he had been dressed up with cakes and lights, the mice said, "How happy you must have been, you old fir-tree."
joy	fairytale_sentences	"What splendid stories you can relate," said the little mice.
joy	fairytale_sentences	The more he talked the more he remembered, and then he thought to himself, "Those were happy days, but they may come again.
joy	fairytale_sentences	And the fir-tree thought of the pretty little birch-tree that grew in the forest, which was to him a real beautiful princess.
joy	fairytale_sentences	And then the tree related the whole story; he could remember every single word, and the little mice was so delighted with it, that they were ready to jump to the top of the tree.
disgust	fairytale_sentences	The next night a great many more mice made their appearance, and on Sunday two rats came with them; but they said, it was not a pretty story at all, and the little mice were very sorry, for it made them also think less of it.
disgust	fairytale_sentences	"Do you know only one story?" asked the rats.
disgust	fairytale_sentences	"We think it is a very miserable story," said the rats.
joy	fairytale_sentences	"Now life is beginning again," said the tree, rejoicing in the sunshine and fresh air.
joy	fairytale_sentences	"Now I shall live," cried the tree, joyfully spreading out its branches; but alas! they were all withered and yellow, and it lay in a corner amongst weeds and nettles.
joy	fairytale_sentences	In the same courtyard two of the merry children were playing who had danced round the tree at Christmas, and had been so happy.
disgust	fairytale_sentences	"Look what is sticking to the ugly old fir-tree," said the child, treading on the branches till they crackled under his boots.
sadness	fairytale_sentences	"Past! past!" said the old tree; "Oh, had I but enjoyed myself while I could have done so! but now it is too late."
sadness	fairytale_sentences	The pieces were placed in a fire under the copper, and they quickly blazed up brightly, while the tree sighed so deeply that each sigh was like a pistol-shot.
joy	fairytale_sentences	His son inherited his wealth, and he lived a merry life with it; he went to a masquerade every night, made kites out of five pound notes, and threw pieces of gold into the sea instead of stones, making ducks and drakes of them.
joy	fairytale_sentences	'Ah! then we grew on the green boughs, and were as green as they; every morning and evening we were fed with diamond drops of dew.
joy	fairytale_sentences	Whenever the sun shone, we felt his warm rays, and the little birds would relate stories to us as they sung.
sadness	fairytale_sentences	But the wood-cutter came, like a great revolution, and our family fell under the axe.
disgust	fairytale_sentences	"'No, I don't like to be always talking of what we are,' remarked the saucepan; 'let us think of some other amusement; I will begin.
joy	fairytale_sentences	On the Baltic Sea, near the Danish shore'- "'What a pretty commencement!' said the plates; 'we shall all like that story, I am sure.'
joy	fairytale_sentences	"'That is quite true,' said the water-bucket; and he made a spring with joy, and splashed some water on the floor.
joy	fairytale_sentences	"The plates rattled with pleasure, and the carpet-broom brought some green parsley out of the dust-hole and crowned the saucepan, for he knew it would vex the others; and he thought, 'If I crown him to-day he will crown me to-morrow.'
joy	fairytale_sentences	"'Now, let us have a dance,' said the fire-tongs; and then how they danced and stuck up one leg in the air.
disgust	fairytale_sentences	"'They were only common people after all,' thought the matches.
joy	fairytale_sentences	There was nothing remarkable about the pen, excepting that it had been dipped too deeply in the ink, but it was proud of that.
disgust	fairytale_sentences	"'I think it highly improper,' said the tea-kettle, who was kitchen singer, and half-brother to the tea-urn, 'that a rich foreign bird should be listened to here.
disgust	fairytale_sentences	"'Yes, if we had chosen,' they each thought, 'we might have spent a very pleasant evening.'
joy	fairytale_sentences	"'Now then,' they thought, 'every one will see that we are the first.
joy	fairytale_sentences	How we shine; what a light we give!'
joy	fairytale_sentences	"What a capital story," said the queen, "I feel as if I were really in the kitchen, and could see the matches; yes, you shall marry our daughter."
joy	fairytale_sentences	"Certainly," said the king, "thou shalt have our daughter."
joy	fairytale_sentences	The street boys stood on tiptoe and shouted "hurrah," and whistled between their fingers; altogether it was a very splendid affair.
joy	fairytale_sentences	As soon as the merchant's son had come down in his flying trunk to the wood after the fireworks, he thought, "I will go back into the town now, and hear what they think of the entertainment."
joy	fairytale_sentences	I see that you are useful, as well as ornamental, my little lady."
joy	fairytale_sentences	"I am a fine gentleman certainly," said the shirt-collar, "I possess a boot-jack and a hair-brush."
joy	fairytale_sentences	"Affectation!" said the shirt-collar.
joy	fairytale_sentences	"Mistress widow," said the shirt-collar, "little mistress widow, I feel quite warm.
joy	fairytale_sentences	"Oh!" exclaimed the shirt-collar, "what a first-rate dancer you would make; you can stretch out your leg so well.
joy	fairytale_sentences	I never saw anything so charming; I am sure no human being could do the same."
sadness	fairytale_sentences	I wish I had an estate for your sake."
sadness	fairytale_sentences	Yes, I have had great experience of this kind, but my greatest grief was for the garter- the girdle I meant to say- that jumped into the wash-tub.
sadness	fairytale_sentences	I have a great deal on my conscience, and it is really time I should be turned into white paper."
joy	fairytale_sentences	Now I have a great opinion of the yard cock on the plank; he is certainly of much more importance than the weather-cock who is placed so high and can't even creak, much less crow.
joy	fairytale_sentences	His step is a dance!
joy	fairytale_sentences	His crowing is music, and wherever he goes one knows what a trumpeter is like!
sadness	fairytale_sentences	If he would only come in here!
joy	fairytale_sentences	Even if he ate me up stump, stalk, and all, and I had to dissolve in his body, it would be a happy death," said the cucumber.
sadness	fairytale_sentences	The wind had blown the planks, but the storm was over.
joy	fairytale_sentences	And the hens and chickens came up on the dung-hill, and the cock strutted about like a lord.
joy	fairytale_sentences	"A happy death!"
joy	fairytale_sentences	The hens and the chickens came, for where one runs the others run too; they clucked, and chirped, and looked at the cock, and were proud that he was of their kind.
joy	fairytale_sentences	"Cock-a-doodle-doo!" he crowed, "the chickens will grow up into great hens at once, if I cry it out in the poultry-yard of the world!"
joy	fairytale_sentences	And hens and chicks clucked and chirped, and the cock announced a great piece of news.
joy	fairytale_sentences	"A cock can lay an egg!
joy	fairytale_sentences	And do you know what's in that egg?
joy	fairytale_sentences	No one can stand the sight of such a thing; people know that, and now you know it too- you know what is in me, and what a champion of all cocks I am!"
joy	fairytale_sentences	With that the yard cock flapped his wings, made his comb swell up, and crowed again; and they all shuddered, the hens and the little chicks- but they were very proud that one of their number was such a champion of all cocks.
joy	fairytale_sentences	They clucked and chirped till the weather-cock heard; he heard it; but he did not stir.
joy	fairytale_sentences	This was a very rude speech, especially against the cask; but the huckster and the student both laughed, for it was only said in fun.
joy	fairytale_sentences	"Now I shall go and tell the student," said the goblin; and with these words he went quietly up the back stairs to the garret where the student lived.
joy	fairytale_sentences	The student no doubt had blown out his candle and gone to bed; but the little goblin remained standing there nevertheless, and listening to the music which still sounded on, soft and beautiful, a sweet cradle-song for the student, who had lain down to rest."
joy	fairytale_sentences	"This is a wonderful place," said the goblin; "I never expected such a thing.
joy	fairytale_sentences	I should like to stay here with the student;" and the little man thought it over, for he was a sensible little spirit.
joy	fairytale_sentences	But after what he had seen, the goblin could no longer sit and listen quietly to the wisdom and understanding down stairs; so, as soon as the evening light glimmered in the garret, he took courage, for it seemed to him as if the rays of light were strong cables, drawing him up, and obliging him to go and peep through the keyhole; and, while there, a feeling of vastness came over him such as we experience by the ever-moving sea, when the storm breaks forth; and it brought tears into his eyes.
joy	fairytale_sentences	And when Christmas came again, and brought the dish of jam and the great lump of butter, he liked the huckster best of all.
joy	fairytale_sentences	"So now I am a breast-pin," said the darning-needle; "I knew very well I should come to honor some day: merit is sure to rise;" and she laughed, quietly to herself, for of course no one ever saw a darning-needle laugh.
joy	fairytale_sentences	And there she sat as proudly as if she were in a state coach, and looked all around her.
joy	fairytale_sentences	So the darning-needle kept up her proud behavior, and did not lose her good humor.
joy	fairytale_sentences	"I suppose you are really a diamond?" she said.
joy	fairytale_sentences	"I have been in a lady's work-box," said the darning-needle, "and this lady was the cook.
joy	fairytale_sentences	She had on each hand five fingers, and anything so conceited as these five fingers I have never seen; and yet they were only employed to take me out of the box and to put me back again."
joy	fairytale_sentences	And so she sat there in her pride, and had many such thoughts as these,- "I could almost fancy that I came from a sunbeam, I am so fine.
sadness	fairytale_sentences	I am so fine that even my mother cannot find me.
sadness	fairytale_sentences	Had I still my old eye, which was broken off, I believe I should weep; but no, I would not do that, it is not genteel to cry."
joy	fairytale_sentences	It was dirty work, but they took great pleasure in it.
joy	fairytale_sentences	The sealing-wax had come off, and she was quite black; but black makes a person look slender, so she thought herself even finer than before.
sadness	fairytale_sentences	He bent his head mournfully, and sighed in deep sorrow, as an unquiet spirit might sigh.
sadness	fairytale_sentences	And the dead man answered, "No one has sung the deeds of my life; they are dead and forgotten.
sadness	fairytale_sentences	Song doth not carry them forth over the lands, nor into the hearts of men; therefore I have no rest and no peace."
joy	fairytale_sentences	Then the face of the dead one gleamed like the margin of the cloud in the moonlight.
joy	fairytale_sentences	Gladly and of good courage, the form arose in splendor and in majesty, and vanished like the glancing of the northern light.
joy	fairytale_sentences	And over the buried town fly the birds of heaven, the small and the great; they twitter and they sing as best they may, each bird with his beak.
joy	fairytale_sentences	"We know the buried town," they say; "everything living in it is piep! piep! piep!"
joy	fairytale_sentences	No death is there- life reigns yonder; we hear it on the notes that swell onward like the tones of the church organ, which seize us like sounds from the elf-hill, like the songs of Ossian, like the rushing swoop of the wandering spirits' wings.
joy	fairytale_sentences	"Oh, that can be easily managed," said the fairy.
joy	fairytale_sentences	"Thank you," said the woman, and she gave the fairy twelve shillings, which was the price of the barleycorn.
joy	fairytale_sentences	"It is a beautiful flower," said the woman, and she kissed the red and golden-colored leaves, and while she did so the flower opened, and she could see that it was a real tulip.
joy	fairytale_sentences	Here she slept at night, but during the day she amused herself on a table, where the woman had placed a plateful of water.
sadness	fairytale_sentences	The tiny little creature woke very early in the morning, and began to cry bitterly when she found where she was, for she could see nothing but water on every side of the large green leaf, and no way of reaching the land.
joy	fairytale_sentences	The old toad bowed low to her in the water, and said, "Here is my son, he will be your husband, and you will live happily in the marsh by the stream."
sadness	fairytale_sentences	"Croak, croak, croak," was all her son could say for himself; so the toad took up the elegant little bed, and swam away with it, leaving Tiny all alone on the green leaf, where she sat and wept.
sadness	fairytale_sentences	She could not bear to think of living with the old toad, and having her ugly son for a husband.
sadness	fairytale_sentences	As soon as they caught sight of her, they saw she was very pretty, and it made them very sorry to think that she must go and live with the ugly toads.
sadness	fairytale_sentences	"No, it must never be!" so they assembled together in the water, round the green stalk which held the leaf on which the little maiden stood, and gnawed it away at the root with their teeth.
joy	fairytale_sentences	Tiny pleased him, and she was glad of it, for now the toad could not possibly reach her, and the country through which she sailed was beautiful, and the sun shone upon the water, till it glittered like liquid gold.
fear	fairytale_sentences	Oh, how frightened little Tiny felt when the cockchafer flew with her to the tree!
sadness	fairytale_sentences	But especially was she sorry for the beautiful white butterfly which she had fastened to the leaf, for if he could not free himself he would die of hunger.
sadness	fairytale_sentences	Then he flew down with her from the tree, and placed her on a daisy, and she wept at the thought that she was so ugly that even the cockchafers would have nothing to say to her.
sadness	fairytale_sentences	During the whole summer poor little Tiny lived quite alone in the wide forest.
sadness	fairytale_sentences	She felt dreadfully cold, for her clothes were torn, and she was herself so frail and delicate, that poor little Tiny was nearly frozen to death.
sadness	fairytale_sentences	Then she wrapped herself up in a dry leaf, but it cracked in the middle and could not keep her warm, and she shivered with cold.
sadness	fairytale_sentences	Oh! how she shivered with the cold.
joy	fairytale_sentences	There dwelt the field-mouse in warmth and comfort, with a whole roomful of corn, a kitchen, and a beautiful dining room.
sadness	fairytale_sentences	Poor little Tiny stood before the door just like a little beggar-girl, and begged for a small piece of barley-corn, for she had been without a morsel to eat for two days.
sadness	fairytale_sentences	"You poor little creature," said the field-mouse, who was really a good old field-mouse, "come into my warm room and dine with me."
joy	fairytale_sentences	She was very pleased with Tiny, so she said, "You are quite welcome to stay with me all the winter, if you like; but you must keep my rooms clean and neat, and tell me stories, for I shall like to hear them very much."
joy	fairytale_sentences	And Tiny did all the field-mouse asked her, and found herself very comfortable.
joy	fairytale_sentences	And the mole fell in love with her because she had such a sweet voice; but he said nothing yet, for he was very cautious.
sadness	fairytale_sentences	In the middle of the floor lay a dead swallow, his beautiful wings pulled close to his sides, his feet and his head drawn up under his feathers; the poor bird had evidently died of the cold.
sadness	fairytale_sentences	It made little Tiny very sad to see it, she did so love the little birds; all the summer they had sung and twittered for her so beautifully.
joy	fairytale_sentences	"Perhaps this was the one who sang to me so sweetly in the summer," she said; "and how much pleasure it gave me, you dear, pretty bird."
sadness	fairytale_sentences	"Farewell, you pretty little bird," said she, "farewell; thank you for your delightful singing during the summer, when all the trees were green, and the warm sun shone upon us.
fear	fairytale_sentences	Tiny trembled very much; she was quite frightened, for the bird was large, a great deal larger than herself,- she was only an inch high.
joy	fairytale_sentences	"Thank you, pretty little maiden," said the sick swallow; "I have been so nicely warmed, that I shall soon regain my strength, and be able to fly about again in the warm sunshine."
joy	fairytale_sentences	Stay in your warm bed; I will take care of you."
sadness	fairytale_sentences	Then she brought the swallow some water in a flower-leaf, and after he had drank, he told her that he had wounded one of his wings in a thorn-bush, and could not fly as fast as the others, who were soon far away on their journey to warm countries.
joy	fairytale_sentences	The whole winter the swallow remained underground, and Tiny nursed him with care and love.
joy	fairytale_sentences	The sun shone in upon them so beautifully, that the swallow asked her if she would go with him; she could sit on his back, he said, and he would fly away with her into the green woods.
sadness	fairytale_sentences	But Tiny knew it would make the field-mouse very grieved if she left her in that manner, so she said, "No, I cannot."
sadness	fairytale_sentences	Tiny looked after him, and the tears rose in her eyes.
sadness	fairytale_sentences	"Tweet, tweet," sang the bird, as he flew out into the green woods, and Tiny felt very sad.
joy	fairytale_sentences	What good fortune for a poor child like you.
joy	fairytale_sentences	Nothing must be wanting when you are the mole's wife."
sadness	fairytale_sentences	But Tiny was not at all pleased; for she did not like the tiresome mole.
sadness	fairytale_sentences	Every morning when the sun rose, and every evening when it went down, she would creep out at the door, and as the wind blew aside the ears of corn, so that she could see the blue sky, she thought how beautiful and bright it seemed out there, and wished so much to see her dear swallow again.
sadness	fairytale_sentences	Then Tiny wept, and said she would not marry the disagreeable mole.
sadness	fairytale_sentences	The poor child was very unhappy at the thought of saying farewell to the beautiful sun, and as the field-mouse had given her permission to stand at the door, she went to look at it once more.
sadness	fairytale_sentences	"Farewell bright sun," she cried, stretching out her arm towards it; and then she walked a short distance from the house; for the corn had been cut, and only the dry stubble remained in the fields.
sadness	fairytale_sentences	"Farewell, farewell," she repeated, twining her arm round a little red flower that grew just by her side.
joy	fairytale_sentences	As soon as he spied Tiny, he was delighted; and then she told him how unwilling she felt to marry the ugly mole, and to live always beneath the earth, and never to see the bright sun any more.
sadness	fairytale_sentences	And as she told him she wept.
joy	fairytale_sentences	"Yes, I will go with you," said Tiny; and she seated herself on the bird's back, with her feet on his outstretched wings, and tied her girdle to one of his strongest feathers.
joy	fairytale_sentences	You must choose for yourself one of those lovely flowers, and I will put you down upon it, and then you shall have everything that you can wish to make you happy."
joy	fairytale_sentences	"That will be delightful," she said, and clapped her little hands for joy.
joy	fairytale_sentences	"Oh, how beautiful he is!" whispered Tiny to the swallow.
joy	fairytale_sentences	The little prince was at first quite frightened at the bird, who was like a giant, compared to such a delicate little creature as himself; but when he saw Tiny, he was delighted, and thought her the prettiest little maiden he had ever seen.
joy	fairytale_sentences	This certainly was a very different sort of husband to the son of a toad, or the mole, with my black velvet and fur; so she said, "Yes," to the handsome prince.
joy	fairytale_sentences	Then all the flowers opened, and out of each came a little lady or a tiny lord, all so pretty it was quite a pleasure to look at them.
joy	fairytale_sentences	We will call you Maia."
sadness	fairytale_sentences	"Farewell, farewell," said the swallow, with a heavy heart as he left the warm countries to fly back into Denmark.
joy	fairytale_sentences	"IT is so delightfully cold," said the Snow Man, "that it makes my whole body crackle.
joy	fairytale_sentences	This is just the kind of wind to blow life into one.
joy	fairytale_sentences	He had been brought into existence amidst the joyous shouts of boys, the jingling of sleigh-bells, and the slashing of whips.
joy	fairytale_sentences	"Ah, I have cured him of staring, though; now he may hang up there, and shine, that I may see myself.
sadness	fairytale_sentences	If I only knew how to manage to move away from this place,- I should so like to move.
sadness	fairytale_sentences	If I could, I would slide along yonder on the ice, as I have seen the boys do; but I don't understand how; I don't even know how to run."
fear	fairytale_sentences	"I don't understand him," said the Snow Man to himself; "but I have a feeling that he is talking of something very disagreeable.
fear	fairytale_sentences	The one who stared so just now, and whom he calls the sun, is not my friend; I can feel that too."
joy	fairytale_sentences	"This is really beautiful," said a young girl, who had come into the garden with a young man; and they both stood still near the Snow Man, and contemplated the glittering scene.
joy	fairytale_sentences	"Summer cannot show a more beautiful sight," she exclaimed, while her eyes sparkled.
joy	fairytale_sentences	The girl laughed, and nodded at the Snow Man, and then tripped away over the snow with her friend.
sadness	fairytale_sentences	Ah, I still dream of that stove.
sadness	fairytale_sentences	"I was obliged," replied the yard-dog.
sadness	fairytale_sentences	"They turned me out of doors, and chained me up here.
sadness	fairytale_sentences	'Bone for bone,' I thought; but they were so angry, and from that time I have been fastened with a chain, and lost my bone.
sadness	fairytale_sentences	I can't talk any more like other dogs.
sadness	fairytale_sentences	Away, away, that is the end of it all."
joy	fairytale_sentences	The night was long, but did not appear so to the Snow Man, who stood there enjoying his own reflections, and crackling with the cold.
joy	fairytale_sentences	"Ah, now I understand why he had such a great longing for the stove," said the yard-dog.
joy	fairytale_sentences	But the girls in the house sang,
joy	fairytale_sentences	Indeed, everything in the emperor's garden was remarkable, and it extended so far that the gardener himself did not know where it ended.
joy	fairytale_sentences	Sometimes, when they went at night to spread their nets, they would hear her sing, and say, "Oh, is not that beautiful?"
joy	fairytale_sentences	Then they would hear it again, and exclaim "Oh, how beautiful is the nightingale's song!"
joy	fairytale_sentences	The books travelled all over the world, and some of them came into the hands of the emperor; and he sat in his golden chair, and, as he read, he nodded his approval every moment, for it pleased him to find such a beautiful description of his city, his palace, and his gardens.
joy	fairytale_sentences	"It is my pleasure that she shall appear this evening." said the emperor; the whole world knows what I possess better than I do myself."
joy	fairytale_sentences	Then the tears come into my eyes, and it is just as if my mother kissed me."
joy	fairytale_sentences	"Hark, hark! there she is," said the girl, "and there she sits," she added, pointing to a little gray bird who was perched on a bough.
joy	fairytale_sentences	"With the greatest pleasure," said the nightingale, and began to sing most delightfully.
joy	fairytale_sentences	"My excellent little nightingale," said the courtier, "I have the great pleasure of inviting you to a court festival this evening, where you will gain imperial favor by your charming song."
joy	fairytale_sentences	The nightingale sang so sweetly that the tears came into the emperor's eyes, and then rolled down his cheeks, as her song became still more touching and went to every one's heart.
joy	fairytale_sentences	The emperor was so delighted that he declared the nightingale should have his gold slipper to wear round her neck, but she declined the honor with thanks: she had been sufficiently rewarded already.
joy	fairytale_sentences	"I have seen tears in an emperor's eyes," she said, "that is my richest reward.
joy	fairytale_sentences	An emperor's tears have wonderful power, and are quite sufficient honor for me;" and then she sang again more enchantingly than ever.
joy	fairytale_sentences	"That singing is a lovely gift;" said the ladies of the court to each other; and then they took water in their mouths to make them utter the gurgling sounds of the nightingale when they spoke to any one, so thay they might fancy themselves nightingales.
joy	fairytale_sentences	And the footmen and chambermaids also expressed their satisfaction, which is saying a great deal, for they are very difficult to please.
sadness	fairytale_sentences	There was certainly not much pleasure in this kind of flying.
joy	fairytale_sentences	"Now they must sing together," said the court, "and what a duet it will be."
sadness	fairytale_sentences	But they did not get on well, for the real nightingale sang in its own natural way, but the artificial bird sang only waltzes.
joy	fairytale_sentences	Three and thirty times did it sing the same tunes without being tired; the people would gladly have heard it again, but the emperor said the living nightingale ought to sing something.
joy	fairytale_sentences	But the music-master praised the bird in the highest degree, and even asserted that it was better than a real nightingale, not only in its dress and the beautiful diamonds, but also in its musical power.
joy	fairytale_sentences	When they heard it they were like people intoxicated; however it must have been with drinking tea, which is quite a Chinese custom.
fear	fairytale_sentences	The music-master wrote a work, in twenty-five volumes, about the artificial bird, which was very learned and very long, and full of the most difficult Chinese words; yet all the people said they had read it, and understood it, for fear of being thought stupid and having their bodies trampled upon.
joy	fairytale_sentences	So a year passed, and the emperor, the court, and all the other Chinese knew every little turn in the artificial bird's song; and for that same reason it pleased them better.
sadness	fairytale_sentences	Now there was great sorrow, as the bird could only be allowed to play once a year; and even that was dangerous for the works inside it.
sadness	fairytale_sentences	Five years passed, and then a real grief came upon the land.
sadness	fairytale_sentences	The Chinese really were fond of their emperor, and he now lay so ill that he was not expected to live.
sadness	fairytale_sentences	Cold and pale lay the emperor in his royal bed; the whole court thought he was dead, and every one ran away to pay homage to his successor.
fear	fairytale_sentences	"Do you recollect that?" they asked one after another, thus bringing to his remembrance circumstances that made the perspiration stand on his brow.
fear	fairytale_sentences	"Music! music!" shouted the emperor.
fear	fairytale_sentences	"You little precious golden bird, sing, pray sing!
joy	fairytale_sentences	"Thanks, thanks, you heavenly little bird.
joy	fairytale_sentences	I banished you from my kingdom once, and yet you have charmed away the evil faces from my bed, and banished Death from my heart, with your sweet song.
joy	fairytale_sentences	"You have already rewarded me," said the nightingale.
joy	fairytale_sentences	"I shall never forget that I drew tears from your eyes the first time I sang to you.
joy	fairytale_sentences	These are the jewels that rejoice a singer's heart.
joy	fairytale_sentences	And as she sung, the emperor fell into a sweet sleep; and how mild and refreshing that slumber was!
joy	fairytale_sentences	"You must always remain with me," said the emperor.
joy	fairytale_sentences	I will sit on a bough outside your window, in the evening, and sing to you, so that you may be happy, and have thoughts full of joy.
sadness	fairytale_sentences	Then he would cry, but what nobody knows nobody cares for; so he would cry till he was tired, and then fall asleep; and while we are asleep we can feel neither hunger nor thirst.
sadness	fairytale_sentences	If he went near the farmyard belonging to the count, he was pushed and knocked about, for the men and the maids said he was so horrible ugly; but he was used to all this, for nobody loved him.
fear	fairytale_sentences	"Heaven help us!" cried the boy at the helm, as the boat heeled over and lay on its beam ends.
sadness	fairytale_sentences	Anne Lisbeth went forth from the castle into the public road, feeling mournful and sad; he whom she had nursed day and night, and even now carried about in her dreams, had been cold and strange, and had not a word or thought respecting her.
sadness	fairytale_sentences	She felt very low-spirited, because her count-child had shown no inclination to speak to her who loved him so well, and who had travelled so far to see him.
sadness	fairytale_sentences	The journey had cost money too, and she had derived no great pleasure from it.
fear	fairytale_sentences	And then they all hung on her, but there were too many; and as they clung the sleeve was torn, and Anne Lisbeth fell down in horror, and awoke.
fear	fairytale_sentences	Indeed she was on the point of falling over in reality with the chair on which she sat; but she was so startled and alarmed that she could not remember what she had dreamed, only that it was something very dreadful.
fear	fairytale_sentences	She shuddered; yet it was nothing save a heap of grass and tangled seaweed flung across a long stone, but it looked like a corpse.
fear	fairytale_sentences	Only tangled grass, and yet she was frightened at it.
fear	fairytale_sentences	As she turned to walk away, much came into her mind that she had heard in her childhood: old superstitions of spectres by the sea-shore; of the ghosts of drowned but unburied people, whose corpses had been washed up on the desolate beach.
fear	fairytale_sentences	"Hold fast! hold fast!" the spectre would cry; and as Anne Lisbeth murmured these words to herself, the whole of her dream was suddenly recalled to her memory, when the mother had clung to her, and uttered these words, when, amid the crashing of worlds, her sleeve had been torn, and she had slipped from the grasp of her child, who wanted to hold her up in that terrible hour.
fear	fairytale_sentences	As these thoughts passed through her mind, fear gave speed to her feet, so that she walked faster and faster.
fear	fairytale_sentences	Fear came upon her as if a cold, clammy hand had been laid upon her heart, so that she almost fainted.
fear	fairytale_sentences	It looked like a pale, rayless surface, and a deadly weight seemed to hang upon her limbs.
fear	fairytale_sentences	She turned in the direction of the church, and the weight on her heart seemed to grow lighter, and even to vanish altogether; but when she turned to go home by the shortest way, it returned.
fear	fairytale_sentences	The mist was cold and damp, her hands and face were moist and clammy with horror, a heavy weight again seized her and clung to her, her mind became clear for thoughts that had never before been there.
fear	fairytale_sentences	"A grave! dig me a grave!" sounded again in her ears, and she would have gladly buried herself, if in the grave she could have found forgetfulness of her actions.
fear	fairytale_sentences	It was the first hour of her awakening, full of anguish and horror.
fear	fairytale_sentences	Superstition made her alternately shudder with cold or burn with the heat of fever.
fear	fairytale_sentences	Many things, of which she had feared even to speak, came into her mind.
fear	fairytale_sentences	"I am the raven-mother; I am the raven-mother," each raven croaked, and Anne Lisbeth felt that the name also applied to her; and she fancied she should be transformed into a black bird, and have to cry as they cried, if she did not dig the grave.
fear	fairytale_sentences	And she threw herself upon the earth, and with her hands dug a grave in the hard ground, so that the blood ran from her fingers.
fear	fairytale_sentences	"A grave! dig me a grave!" still sounded in her ears; she was fearful that the cock might crow, and the first red streak appear in the east, before she had finished her work; and then she would be lost.
sadness	fairytale_sentences	"I ought to tell you a story, but the worst of it is, I do not know any more."
sadness	fairytale_sentences	"'But first we went to school to learn something,' she said, 'and then we were confirmed; we both wept on that day, but in the afternoon we went out hand in hand, and ascended the high round tower and looked out into the wide world right over Copenhagen and the sea; then we walked to Fredericksburg, where the king and the queen were sailing about in their magnificent boat on the canals.'
sadness	fairytale_sentences	"'And I often cried about you, for I was afraid lest you were drowned and lying at the bottom of the sea.
sadness	fairytale_sentences	"But we have no theatre," cried little Anna, "and we have no one to act for us; my old doll cannot, for she is a fright, and my new one cannot, for she must not rumple her new clothes."
sadness	fairytale_sentences	"'Though I'm all ear, Very stupid I appear: Where's my humor?
sadness	fairytale_sentences	"My poor flowers are quite dead," said little Ida, "they were so pretty yesterday evening, and now all the leaves are hanging down quite withered.
sadness	fairytale_sentences	To-morrow morning we shall be quite dead; and you must tell little Ida to bury us in the garden, near to the grave of the canary; then, in the summer we shall wake up and be more beautiful than ever."
sadness	fairytale_sentences	"No, you must not die," said Sophy, as she kissed the flowers.
fear	fairytale_sentences	And how fierce they are!
fear	fairytale_sentences	But what a kribbling and krabbling was there!
sadness	fairytale_sentences	And he thought it over and over, but it would not do, and so he had recourse to magic.
sadness	fairytale_sentences	"I must give them color, that they may be seen more plainly," said he; and he poured something like a little drop of red wine into the drop of water, but it was witches' blood from the lobes of the ear, the finest kind, at ninepence a drop.
fear	fairytale_sentences	But it is not so easy to find out if one does not know.
fear	fairytale_sentences	Those at the top were being pulled down, and those at the bottom were struggling upwards.
sadness	fairytale_sentences	There is one who has a little bruise.
sadness	fairytale_sentences	It hurts him, but it shall hurt him still more."
sadness	fairytale_sentences	And there was one sitting as still as any little maiden, and wishing only for peace and quietness.
sadness	fairytale_sentences	The mother wept; the father in fancy saw him "famous;" the town musician was of opinion that he ought not to go to war, but should stay at home and learn music.
sadness	fairytale_sentences	She folded her hands, and hid her face in the cotton curtains of the bed, and wept.
sadness	fairytale_sentences	Perhaps he's in the water in the marsh!
sadness	fairytale_sentences	Nobody knows his grave; no holy words have been read over it!"
sadness	fairytale_sentences	And the Lord's Prayer went inaudibly over her lips; she bowed her head, and was so weary that she went to sleep.
sadness	fairytale_sentences	"Nothing, nothing; only leave me to myself," he answered but the tears were running down his cheeks.
sadness	fairytale_sentences	"My sweet child, my golden treasure!" cried the mother, and she wept; but the Fire-drum sang, not out loud, but inwardly.
sadness	fairytale_sentences	If his father had only lived to see it!"
sadness	fairytale_sentences	"Ah, yes, no doubt," said the fern, "but you do not know the world yet as well as I do, for my sticks are knotty;" and then it sung quite mournfully-
sadness	fairytale_sentences	"Snip, snap, snurre, Basse lurre: The song is ended."
fear	fairytale_sentences	"Only half a quartern," stammered the boy in a frightened voice.
sadness	fairytale_sentences	"I work hard and suffer pain with my poor hands," said she, "but I do it willingly, that I may be able to bring you up honestly and truthfully, my dear boy."
sadness	fairytale_sentences	"Oh, he was such a kind, good-hearted man, there are not many like him," and the tears rolled down her cheeks as she spoke.
sadness	fairytale_sentences	Then she cried, "Oh, dear me; I feel quite ill: everything is going round me, I cannot bear it.
sadness	fairytale_sentences	The limbs of the laundress shook under her, and she said, "I have stood too long in the cold water, and I have had nothing to eat the whole day since the morning.
sadness	fairytale_sentences	O kind Heaven, help me to get home; I am in a burning fever.
sadness	fairytale_sentences	Oh, my poor child," and she burst into tears.
sadness	fairytale_sentences	And he, poor boy, wept also, as he sat alone by the river, near to and watching the damp linen.
sadness	fairytale_sentences	I kissed her hand, and wept bitter tears, and I wept still more when I went to my room, and threw myself on the bed.
sadness	fairytale_sentences	I passed through a dreadful night; God knows what I suffered, and how I struggled.
sadness	fairytale_sentences	I saw him, looking pale as death, and deeply troubled, standing at her grave; for she was his mother.
sadness	fairytale_sentences	Sometime after, when his father died, he was in foreign lands, and did not come home.
sadness	fairytale_sentences	We were backward in our payments, we borrowed more money, and all that we had was lost and sold, and then my husband died.
sadness	fairytale_sentences	Since then I have worked, toiled, and striven for the sake of the child.
sadness	fairytale_sentences	"Oh, my poor mother!" he cried, while the tears rolled down his cheeks.
sadness	fairytale_sentences	"Is it true what they say, that she was good for nothing?"
sadness	fairytale_sentences	"Poor little Ephemera!" said the oak; "what a terribly short life!"
sadness	fairytale_sentences	Crows and rooks came by turns and sat on them, and talked of the hard times which were beginning, and how difficult it was in winter to obtain food.
sadness	fairytale_sentences	The grand, majestic oak could not be quite happy in the midst of his enjoyment, while all the rest, both great and small, were not with him.
sadness	fairytale_sentences	And this feeling of yearning trembled through every branch, through every leaf, as warmly and fervently as if they had been the fibres of a human heart.
sadness	fairytale_sentences	Who can replace it?
sadness	fairytale_sentences	Alas! no one."
fear	fairytale_sentences	"Oh, take me with you," cried Christina; and she sprang after him.
sadness	fairytale_sentences	They ran on a little farther, and then Christina fell down, and began to cry.
fear	fairytale_sentences	But the house was not yonder; and they wandered still farther, over the dry rustling leaves of the last year, and treading on fallen branches that crackled under their little feet; then they heard a loud, piercing cry, and they stood still to listen.
fear	fairytale_sentences	Presently the scream of an eagle sounded through the wood; it was an ugly cry, and it frightened the children; but before them, in the thickest part of the forest, grew the most beautiful blackberries, in wonderful quantities.
fear	fairytale_sentences	Presently they heard the frightful scream again, and Christina said, "We shall get into trouble about that pig."
fear	fairytale_sentences	So they went on, but the road led them out of the way; no house could be seen, it grew dark, and the children were afraid.
sadness	fairytale_sentences	At last they both lost themselves in the thicket; Christina began to cry, and then Ib cried too; and, after weeping and lamenting for some time, they stretched themselves down on the dry leaves and fell asleep.
fear	fairytale_sentences	He had something else to say, which made him hesitate in a strange manner.
sadness	fairytale_sentences	At first Ib said not a word, but he became as white as the wall, and shook his head gently, and then he spoke,- "Christina must not refuse this good fortune."
sadness	fairytale_sentences	Ib sat down to write, but he could not get on at all.
fear	fairytale_sentences	"Charming!
fear	fairytale_sentences	Kaela stood silent, but nodded in approbation of what he said, while mamma-in-law made the following confession:- "It is difficult to follow you; but I go hobbling along after you with my thoughts, though what you say makes my head whirl round and round.
fear	fairytale_sentences	Mrs. Meta was now on the chain, she could not even bark.
anger	fairytale_sentences	"It is done to annoy me, so I intend to go out into the world and seek my fortune."
anger	fairytale_sentences	"You're a rude fellow," cried the beetle, as he walked out of the stable; and then he flew for a short distance, till he found himself in a beautiful flower-garden, all fragrant with roses and lavender.
fear	fairytale_sentences	He began to doubt whether he should escape with his life, so he remained, quietly lying where he was.
anger	fairytale_sentences	Towards morning he crept out of his hiding-place, feeling in a very bad temper with the climate.
fear	fairytale_sentences	"That is quite out in the great world, on the other side of the ditch," answered an earwig, "I hope none of my children will ever go so far, it would be the death of me."
fear	fairytale_sentences	He twisted and turned about with all his might, but he got a good squeeze from the boy's hand, as a hint for him to keep quiet.
anger	fairytale_sentences	This vexes me more than anything.
anger	fairytale_sentences	But it is useless to look for sympathy in this world.
anger	fairytale_sentences	The beast began to roar and bellow, till all the birds of the wood flew away for fright; but the horse let him sing on, and made his way quietly over the fields to his master"s house.
anger	fairytale_sentences	"O, you fool!" said she, "then we must all four die of hunger, you may as well plane the planks for our coffins," and she left him no peace until he consented.
anger	fairytale_sentences	She gave each a little piece of bread, and said: "There is something for your dinner, but do not eat it up before then, for you will get nothing else."
anger	fairytale_sentences	Pay attention, and do not forget how to use your legs."
anger	fairytale_sentences	They knocked at the door, and when the woman opened it and saw that it was Hansel and Gretel, she said: "You naughty children, why have you slept so long in the forest?--we thought you were never coming back at all!"
anger	fairytale_sentences	The woman, however, would listen to nothing that he had to say, but scolded and reproached him.
anger	fairytale_sentences	"Hansel, why do you stop and look round?" said the father, "go on."
anger	fairytale_sentences	"Fool!" said the woman, "that is not your little pigeon, that is the morning sun that is shining on the chimney."
fear	fairytale_sentences	The woman led the children still deeper into the forest, where they had never in their lives been before.
fear	fairytale_sentences	"The wind, the wind, The heaven-born wind,"
fear	fairytale_sentences	Hansel and Gretel were so terribly frightened that they let fall what they had in their hands.
fear	fairytale_sentences	Scream as he might, it would not help him.
anger	fairytale_sentences	Every morning the woman crept to the little stable, and cried: "Hansel, stretch out your finger that I may feel if you will soon be fat."
anger	fairytale_sentences	When four weeks had gone by, and Hansel still remained thin, she was seized with impatience and would not wait any longer.
anger	fairytale_sentences	"Just keep your noise to yourself," said the old woman, "it won"t help you at all."
fear	fairytale_sentences	She pushed poor Gretel out to the oven, from which flames of fire were already darting.
fear	fairytale_sentences	"Creep in," said the witch, "and see if it is properly heated, so that we can put the bread in."
anger	fairytale_sentences	Oh! then she began to howl quite horribly, but Gretel ran away and the godless witch was miserably burnt to death.
fear	fairytale_sentences	Then the father started, trembling with fear and horror, and saw what it was that he had bound himself to do; but as no gold was come, he made himself easy by thinking that it was only a joke that the dwarf was playing him, and that, at any rate, when the money came, he should see the bearer, and would not take it in.
fear	fairytale_sentences	The little black dwarf soon came, and walked round and round about the circle, but could not find any way to get into it, and he either could not, or dared not, jump over it.
fear	fairytale_sentences	But the queen was against his going, and said, "I know well that misfortunes will come upon us if you go."
anger	fairytale_sentences	At this the son was vexed; and forgetting his word, turned his ring, and wished for his queen and son.
anger	fairytale_sentences	He did all he could to soothe her, and she at last seemed to be appeased; but she was not so in truth, and was only thinking how she should punish him.
anger	fairytale_sentences	"False and fickle one!" said he.
anger	fairytale_sentences	The king ordered the man to be brought before him, and threatened with angry words that unless he could before the morrow point out the thief, he himself should be looked upon as guilty and executed.
fear	fairytale_sentences	In his trouble and fear he went down into the courtyard and took thought how to help himself out of his trouble.
anger	fairytale_sentences	That stupid horse, with his heavy hoofs, has been treading down my people without mercy!"
anger	fairytale_sentences	At night when he was going to drive the herd home again, he said to the calf: "If you can stand there and eat your fill, you can also go on your four legs; I don"t care to drag you home again in my arms."
fear	fairytale_sentences	But the little peasant stood at his door, and waited for his little calf, and when the cow-herd drove the cows through the village, and the calf was missing, he inquired where it was.
anger	fairytale_sentences	It would not stop and come with us."
fear	fairytale_sentences	But the little peasant said: "Oh, but I must have my beast back again."
fear	fairytale_sentences	Then they went back to the meadow together, but someone had stolen the calf, and it was gone.
fear	fairytale_sentences	The cow-herd said: "It must have run away."
anger	fairytale_sentences	The peasant, however, said: "Don"t tell me that," and led the cow-herd before the mayor, who for his carelessness condemned him to give the peasant a cow for the calf which had run away.
fear	fairytale_sentences	But as the weather grew so bad and there was a storm of rain and wind, he could go no farther, and turned back to the mill and begged for shelter.
anger	fairytale_sentences	The peasant listened, and when he heard them talk about feasting he was vexed that he had been forced to make shift with a slice of bread and cheese.
fear	fairytale_sentences	Then she opened the door for her husband, and said: "Thank heaven, you are back again!
fear	fairytale_sentences	There is such a storm, it looks as if the world were coming to an end."
anger	fairytale_sentences	The woman said: "But I have nothing but bread and cheese."
fear	fairytale_sentences	And now the two sat down to the table together, but the miller"s wife was frightened to death, and went to bed and took all the keys with her.
fear	fairytale_sentences	The miller would have liked much to know the fifth, but the little peasant said: "First, we will quickly eat the four things, for the fifth is something bad."
fear	fairytale_sentences	The miller asked: "What did he say?"
fear	fairytale_sentences	The peasant replied: "He says that the Devil is hiding outside there in the closet on the porch."
fear	fairytale_sentences	The miller said: "The Devil must go out," and opened the house-door; then the woman was forced to give up the keys, and the peasant unlocked the closet.
fear	fairytale_sentences	Then the small peasant was brought before the mayor, and bidden to say from whence his wealth came.
anger	fairytale_sentences	The mayor, however, said: "But my servant must go first."
anger	fairytale_sentences	When she came to the merchant in the town, he did not give her more than two talers for a skin, and when the others came, he did not give them so much, and said: "What can I do with all these skins?"
anger	fairytale_sentences	Then the peasants were vexed that the small peasant should have thus outwitted them, wanted to take vengeance on him, and accused him of this treachery before the major.
fear	fairytale_sentences	The innocent little peasant was unanimously sentenced to death, and was to be rolled into the water, in a barrel pierced full of holes.
fear	fairytale_sentences	He was led forth, and a priest was brought who was to say a mass for his soul.
fear	fairytale_sentences	He said to him: "I set you free from the closet, set me free from the barrel."
fear	fairytale_sentences	The peasant said: "They want to make me mayor, if I will but put myself in the barrel, but I will not do it."
fear	fairytale_sentences	The peasant said: "If you will get in, you will be mayor."
fear	fairytale_sentences	When the barrel began to roll, the shepherd cried: "I am quite willing to be mayor."
anger	fairytale_sentences	Then the mannikin grew very angry and said he was to do it, but the huntsman would not, and took my dear mannikin, and gave him a thorough beating.
fear	fairytale_sentences	Then the mannikin screamed terribly, and cried, "Stop, stop, and let me go, and I will tell thee where the King"s daughters are."
fear	fairytale_sentences	The two other brothers would also be very glad to recover the King"s daughters, but they did not want to have any trouble or danger.
anger	fairytale_sentences	Then the two were so angry at this that they grew green and yellow.
anger	fairytale_sentences	Hereupon the King was angry, and ordered him to be put in prison at once, because he thought he must have done some injury to the children.
anger	fairytale_sentences	Then he caused the two brothers to be hanged on the gallows, and to the third he gave his youngest daughter, and on that occasion I wore a pair of glass shoes, and I struck them against a stone, and they said, "Klink," and were broken.
anger	fairytale_sentences	The bear would have liked to go at once, but the wolf held him back by the sleeve, and said: "No, you must wait until the lord and lady Queen have gone away again."
anger	fairytale_sentences	The bear, however, could not rest until he had seen the royal palace, and when a short time had passed, went to it again.
anger	fairytale_sentences	"Is that the royal palace?" cried the bear; "it is a wretched palace, and you are not King"s children, you are disreputable children!"
anger	fairytale_sentences	When the young wrens heard that, they were frightfully angry, and screamed: "No, that we are not!
anger	fairytale_sentences	Our parents are honest people!
anger	fairytale_sentences	Bear, you will have to pay for that!"
fear	fairytale_sentences	The bear and the wolf grew uneasy, and turned back and went into their holes.
anger	fairytale_sentences	The young willow-wrens, however, continued to cry and scream, and when their parents again brought food they said: "We will not so much as touch one fly"s leg, no, not if we were dying of hunger, until you have settled whether we are respectable children or not; the bear has been here and has insulted us!"
anger	fairytale_sentences	Then the old King said: "Be easy, he shall be punished," and he at once flew with the Queen to the bear"s cave, and called in: "Old Growler, why have you insulted my children?
anger	fairytale_sentences	You shall suffer for it--we will punish you by a bloody war."
fear	fairytale_sentences	When day broke, and the battle was to begin, all the four-footed animals came running up with such a noise that the earth trembled.
fear	fairytale_sentences	The willow-wren with his army also came flying through the air with such a humming, and whirring, and swarming that every one was uneasy and afraid, and on both sides they advanced against each other.
anger	fairytale_sentences	When the fox felt the first string, he started so that he one leg, from pain, but he bore it, and still kept his tail high in the air; at the second sting, he was forced to put it down for a moment; at the third, he could hold out no longer, screamed, and put his tail between his legs.
anger	fairytale_sentences	Then the willow-wren flew to the bear"s hole and cried: "Growler, you are to come to the nest to my children, and beg their pardon, or else every rib of your body shall be broken."
fear	fairytale_sentences	So the bear crept thither in the greatest fear, and begged their pardon.
fear	fairytale_sentences	While she was making the most of it, her master came and cried: "Hurry up, Gretel, the guest is coming directly after me!"
fear	fairytale_sentences	Gretel ran, and looked to see who was there, and when she saw the guest, she put her finger to her lips and said: "Hush! hush! go away as quickly as you can, if my master catches you it will be the worse for you; he certainly did ask you to supper, but his intention is to cut off your two ears.
fear	fairytale_sentences	Just listen how he is sharpening the knife for it!"
fear	fairytale_sentences	The guest heard the sharpening, and hurried down the steps again as fast as he could.
anger	fairytale_sentences	Gretel was not idle; she ran screaming to her master, and cried: "You have invited a fine guest!"
anger	fairytale_sentences	"Yes," said she, "he has taken the chickens which I was just going to serve up, off the dish, and has run away with them!"
fear	fairytale_sentences	The guest, however, thought no otherwise than that he was to give up one of his ears, and ran as if fire were burning under him, in order to take them both with him.
anger	fairytale_sentences	So the lord had the horses harnessed to his carriage, drove out to the village, and asked Crabb if he were Doctor Knowall.
fear	fairytale_sentences	Yes, he was, he said.
fear	fairytale_sentences	"Oh, yes, but Grete, my wife, must go too."
anger	fairytale_sentences	"Yes, but my wife, Grete, too," said he, and he seated himself with her at the table.
fear	fairytale_sentences	And when the first servant came with a dish of delicate fare, the peasant nudged his wife, and said: "Grete, that was the first," meaning that was the servant who brought the first dish.
fear	fairytale_sentences	The servant, however, thought he intended by that to say: "That is the first thief," and as he actually was so, he was terrified, and said to his comrade outside: "The doctor knows all: we shall fare ill, he said I was the first."
fear	fairytale_sentences	The second did not want to go in at all, but was forced.
fear	fairytale_sentences	This servant was equally alarmed, and he got out as fast as he could.
fear	fairytale_sentences	The third fared no better, for the peasant again said: "Grete, that is the third."
fear	fairytale_sentences	The fourth had to carry in a dish that was covered, and the lord told the doctor that he was to show his skill, and guess what was beneath the cover.
fear	fairytale_sentences	On this the servants looked terribly uneasy, and made a sign to the doctor that they wished him to step outside for a moment.
fear	fairytale_sentences	When therefore he went out, all four of them confessed to him that they had stolen the money, and said that they would willingly restore it and give him a heavy sum into the bargain, if he would not denounce them, for if he did they would be hanged.
fear	fairytale_sentences	They led him to the spot where the money was concealed.
fear	fairytale_sentences	The fifth servant, however, crept into the stove to hear if the doctor knew still more.
anger	fairytale_sentences	As he could not find it immediately he said: "I know you are there, so you had better come out!"
fear	fairytale_sentences	Then the fellow in the stove thought that the doctor meant him, and full of terror, sprang out, crying: "That man knows everything!"
anger	fairytale_sentences	When any young man came within a hundred paces of her castle, he became quite fixed, and could not move a step till she came and set him free; which she would not do till he had given her his word never to come there again: but when any pretty maiden came within that space she was changed into a bird, and the fairy put her into a cage, and hung her up in a chamber in the castle.
fear	fairytale_sentences	One day they went to walk in the wood, that they might be alone; and Jorindel said, "We must take care that we don"t go too near to the fairy"s castle."
fear	fairytale_sentences	Then he shrank for fear, turned pale, and trembled.
fear	fairytale_sentences	when her song stopped suddenly.
fear	fairytale_sentences	An owl with fiery eyes flew three times round them, and three times screamed:
fear	fairytale_sentences	"Tu whu!
fear	fairytale_sentences	Tu whu!
fear	fairytale_sentences	Tu whu!"
fear	fairytale_sentences	Jorindel could not move; he stood fixed as a stone, and could neither weep, nor speak, nor stir hand or foot.
anger	fairytale_sentences	And now the sun went quite down; the gloomy night came; the owl flew into a bush; and a moment after the old fairy came forth pale and meagre, with staring eyes, and a nose and chin that almost met one another.
anger	fairytale_sentences	She mumbled something to herself, seized the nightingale, and went away with it in her hand.
fear	fairytale_sentences	He could not speak, he could not move from the spot where he stood.
anger	fairytale_sentences	"Till the prisoner is fast, And her doom is cast, There stay!
anger	fairytale_sentences	Oh, stay!
anger	fairytale_sentences	When the charm is around her, And the spell has bound her, Hie away! away!"
fear	fairytale_sentences	Then he plucked the flower, and set out and travelled day and night, till he came again to the castle.
anger	fairytale_sentences	When she saw Jorindel she was very angry, and screamed with rage; but she could not come within two yards of him, for the flower he held in his hand was his safeguard.
fear	fairytale_sentences	He looked around at the birds, but alas! there were many, many nightingales, and how then should he find out which was his Jorinda?
fear	fairytale_sentences	While he was thinking what to do, he saw the fairy had taken down one of the cages, and was making the best of her way off through the door.
fear	fairytale_sentences	Immediately a great fear fell on her.
fear	fairytale_sentences	Her terror too would not quit her, let her do what she might, and her heart beat continually and would not be still; the gold too stayed on her finger, and would not go away, let her rub it and wash it never so much.
fear	fairytale_sentences	"No," she replied.
anger	fairytale_sentences	Then she said once again, "Art thou certain that thou hast not done it?"
fear	fairytale_sentences	"Yes," said the girl, for the second time.
anger	fairytale_sentences	Then she perceived the finger which had become golden from touching the fire of heaven, and saw well that the child had sinned, and said for the third time "Hast thou not done it?"
fear	fairytale_sentences	"No," said the girl for the third time.
anger	fairytale_sentences	Then said the Virgin Mary, "Thou hast not obeyed me, and besides that thou hast lied, thou art no longer worthy to be in heaven."
anger	fairytale_sentences	Next morning, when this child also had disappeared, the people declared quite loudly that the Queen had devoured it, and the King"s councillors demanded that she should be brought to justice.
anger	fairytale_sentences	The King, however, loved her so dearly that he would not believe it, and commanded the councillors under pain of death not to say any more about it.
fear	fairytale_sentences	The wood was got together, and when she was fast bound to the stake, and the fire began to burn round about her, the hard ice of pride melted, her heart was moved by repentance, and she thought, "If I could but confess before my death that I opened the door."
fear	fairytale_sentences	Then her voice came back to her, and she cried out loudly, "Yes, Mary, I did it;" and straight-way rain fell from the sky and extinguished the flames of fire, and a light broke forth above her, and the Virgin Mary descended with the two little sons by her side, and the new-born daughter in her arms.
anger	fairytale_sentences	The man said, "I could tear myself to pieces!
anger	fairytale_sentences	If I had but known that!
anger	fairytale_sentences	Then at last he was angry, and cried quite impatiently, "I wish your neck was broken!"
anger	fairytale_sentences	And now as he was walking slowly through the sand, and the sun was burning hot at noon-day, he grew quite hot-tempered and angry.
anger	fairytale_sentences	This really did vex him, and before he was aware, he said, "I just wish she was sitting there on this saddle, and could not get off it, instead of my having to drag it along on my back."
anger	fairytale_sentences	Then he really did feel warm.
anger	fairytale_sentences	She, however, called him a fool, and said, "What good will all the riches on earth do me, if I am to sit on this saddle?
anger	fairytale_sentences	Thou hast wished me on it, so thou must help me off."
fear	fairytale_sentences	His master therefore was tired of keeping him and began to think of putting an end to him; but the ass, who saw that some mischief was in the wind, took himself slyly off, and began his journey towards the great city, "For there," thought he, "I may turn musician."
fear	fairytale_sentences	"Why," said the cock, "I was just now saying that we should have fine weather for our washing-day, and yet my mistress and the cook don"t thank me for my pains, but threaten to cut off my head tomorrow, and make broth of me for the guests that are coming on Sunday!"
fear	fairytale_sentences	So they walked off together towards the spot where Chanticleer had seen the light, and as they drew near it became larger and brighter, till they at last came close to a house in which a gang of robbers lived.
fear	fairytale_sentences	The robbers, who had been not a little frightened by the opening concert, had now no doubt that some frightful hobgoblin had broken in upon them, and scampered away as fast as they could.
anger	fairytale_sentences	But about midnight, when the robbers saw from afar that the lights were out and that all seemed quiet, they began to think that they had been in too great a hurry to run away; and one of them, who was bolder than the rest, went to see what was going on.
fear	fairytale_sentences	This frightened him dreadfully, and away he ran to the back door; but there the dog jumped up and bit him in the leg; and as he was crossing over the yard the ass kicked him; and the cock, who had been awakened by the noise, crowed with all his might.
fear	fairytale_sentences	At this the robber ran back as fast as he could to his comrades, and told the captain how a horrid witch had got into the house, and had spat at him and scratched his face with her long bony fingers; how a man with a knife in his hand had hidden himself behind the door, and stabbed him in the leg; how a black monster stood in the yard and struck him with a club, and how the devil had sat upon the top of the house and cried out, "Throw the rascal up here!"
fear	fairytale_sentences	His father stood by, but could not utter a sound for terror, and he thought nothing else but that his child was lost, and that as long as he lived he should never set eyes on him again.
fear	fairytale_sentences	However, as he was afraid of this great man, he left go of the plough, stepped back and stood at one side of the piece of land.
anger	fairytale_sentences	The farmer could not bear to see that, and called to him, "If thou art determined to plough, thou must not press so hard on it, that makes bad work."
anger	fairytale_sentences	Then the miser grew angry, and said, "Oh, but I can"t make any use of you, you strike far too powerfully; what will you have for the one blow?"
anger	fairytale_sentences	"Ah," said he quite roughly and surlily, "you may just go, then; I shall be back again before any of you."
fear	fairytale_sentences	The bailiff, however, was afraid of the blows which he was to receive, and earnestly entreated him to excuse him from having them; for rather than that, he himself would be head-servant, and the youth should be bailiff.
fear	fairytale_sentences	Then the bailiff did not know what to do, and begged for a fortnight"s delay, for he wanted to find some way of escape.
anger	fairytale_sentences	When he was standing down below at the bottom, they rolled down the largest mill-stone and thought they had broken his skull, but he cried, "Chase away those hens from the well, they are scratching in the sand up there, and throwing the grains into my eyes, so that I can"t see."
fear	fairytale_sentences	The head-servant now wanted to take his reward, but the bailiff again begged for a fortnight"s delay.
anger	fairytale_sentences	Then he said, "If anything of that kind comes again, I shall strike out in return."
fear	fairytale_sentences	When the bailiff heard that, he was seriously alarmed and quite beside himself; he walked backwards and forwards in the room, and drops of perspiration ran down from his forehead.
fear	fairytale_sentences	She cried, "No, no I cannot bear it," and opened the other window, because drops of perspiration were running down her forehead.
anger	fairytale_sentences	A farmer had a faithful and diligent servant, who had worked hard for him three years, without having been paid any wages.
anger	fairytale_sentences	At last it came into the man"s head that he would not go on thus without pay any longer; so he went to his master, and said, "I have worked hard for you a long time, I will trust to you to give me what I deserve to have for my trouble."
anger	fairytale_sentences	The miser crept into the bush to find it; but directly he had got into the middle, his companion took up his fiddle and played away, and the miser began to dance and spring about, capering higher and higher in the air.
fear	fairytale_sentences	The thorns soon began to tear his clothes till they all hung in rags about him, and he himself was all scratched and wounded, so that the blood ran down.
anger	fairytale_sentences	"Thou hast shaved many a poor soul close enough," said the other; "thou art only meeting thy reward": so he played up another tune.
anger	fairytale_sentences	Meanwhile the miser crept out of the bush half-naked and in a piteous plight, and began to ponder how he should take his revenge, and serve his late companion some trick.
anger	fairytale_sentences	At last he went to the judge, and complained that a rascal had robbed him of his money, and beaten him into the bargain; and that the fellow who did it carried a bow at his back and a fiddle hung round his neck.
anger	fairytale_sentences	The miser began to tell his tale, and said he had been robbed of his money.
anger	fairytale_sentences	"No, you gave it me for playing a tune to you." said the countryman; but the judge told him that was not likely, and cut the matter short by ordering him off to the gallows.
fear	fairytale_sentences	So away he was taken; but as he stood on the steps he said, "My Lord Judge, grant me one last request."
anger	fairytale_sentences	"Anything but thy life," replied the other.
fear	fairytale_sentences	"No," said he, "I do not ask my life; only to let me play upon my fiddle for the last time."
anger	fairytale_sentences	But the judge said, "It is only this once, he will soon have done."
anger	fairytale_sentences	The fact was, he could not refuse the request, on account of the dwarf"s third gift.
fear	fairytale_sentences	Then the miser said, "Bind me fast, bind me fast, for pity"s sake."
anger	fairytale_sentences	But the countryman seized his fiddle, and struck up a tune, and at the first note judge, clerks, and jailer were in motion; all began capering, and no one could hold the miser.
anger	fairytale_sentences	At the second note the hangman let his prisoner go, and danced also, and by the time he had played the first bar of the tune, all were dancing together--judge, court, and miser, and all the people who had followed to look on.
anger	fairytale_sentences	Then he called to the miser, and said, "Tell us now, you vagabond, where you got that gold, or I shall play on for your amusement only," "I stole it," said the miser in the presence of all the people; "I acknowledge that I stole it, and that you earned it fairly."
anger	fairytale_sentences	Then the countryman stopped his fiddle, and left the miser to take his place at the gallows.
fear	fairytale_sentences	The kernel, however, was so large that she could not swallow it, and it remained sticking in her throat, so that she was alarmed lest she should be choked.
fear	fairytale_sentences	Then she cried, "Cock, I entreat thee to run as fast thou canst, and fetch me some water, or I shall choke."
fear	fairytale_sentences	The little cock did run as fast as he could to the spring, and said, "Stream, thou art to give me some water; the little hen is lying on the nut- hill, and she has swallowed a large nut, and is choking."
fear	fairytale_sentences	The man, who loved her, thought: "Sooner than let your wife die, bring her some of the rampion yourself, let it cost what it will."
anger	fairytale_sentences	If he was to have any rest, her husband must once more descend into the garden.
fear	fairytale_sentences	In the gloom of evening therefore, he let himself down again; but when he had clambered down the wall he was terribly afraid, for he saw the enchantress standing before him.
anger	fairytale_sentences	"How can you dare," said she with angry look, "descend into my garden and steal my rampion like a thief?
anger	fairytale_sentences	You shall suffer for it!"
fear	fairytale_sentences	"Ah," answered he, "let mercy take the place of justice, I only made up my mind to do it out of necessity.
fear	fairytale_sentences	My wife saw your rampion from the window, and felt such a longing for it that she would have died if she had not got some to eat."
fear	fairytale_sentences	The man in his terror consented to everything, and when the woman was brought to bed, the enchantress appeared at once, gave the child the name of Rapunzel, and took it away with her.
fear	fairytale_sentences	At first Rapunzel was terribly frightened when a man, such as her eyes had never yet beheld, came to her; but the king"s son began to talk to her quite like a friend, and told her that his heart had been so stirred that it had let him have no rest, and he had been forced to see her.
anger	fairytale_sentences	"Ah! you wicked child," cried the enchantress.
anger	fairytale_sentences	"What do I hear you say!
anger	fairytale_sentences	I thought I had separated you from all the world, and yet you have deceived me!"
anger	fairytale_sentences	"Aha!" she cried mockingly, "you would fetch your dearest, but the beautiful bird sits no longer singing in the nest; the cat has got it, and will scratch out your eyes as well.
anger	fairytale_sentences	Rapunzel is lost to you; you will never see her again."
anger	fairytale_sentences	One day the child was very troublesome, and the mother could not quiet it, do what she would.
anger	fairytale_sentences	She grew impatient, and seeing the ravens flying round the castle, she opened the window, and said: "I wish you were a raven and would fly away, then I should have a little peace."
anger	fairytale_sentences	But she would not leave him alone, and urged him saying, "If you will not eat anything, at least you might take a draught of wine; one drink counts for nothing," and at last he allowed himself to be persuaded, and drank.
fear	fairytale_sentences	He thought to himself, "If the giant sees me going in, my life will not be worth much."
fear	fairytale_sentences	However, after a while he summoned up courage and went forward.
fear	fairytale_sentences	"I would rather you let that alone," said the man, "for I do not willingly give myself up to be eaten; if you are wanting food I have enough to satisfy your hunger."
anger	fairytale_sentences	They stopped when they heard the call, but looking round and seeing nobody, they went on again with their fighting, which now became more furious.
anger	fairytale_sentences	"God be with you," he cried again, and again they paused and looked about, but seeing no one went back to their fighting.
anger	fairytale_sentences	They had been unable to decide whether they would keep together and have the things in common, or whether they would separate.
fear	fairytale_sentences	"Do give me one night"s lodging, and a little to eat and drink," said he to her, "or I shall starve."
fear	fairytale_sentences	"What do you wish?" said the soldier.
fear	fairytale_sentences	The soldier consented, and next day laboured with all his strength, but could not finish it by the evening.
fear	fairytale_sentences	She did draw him up, but when he came near the edge, she stretched down her hand and wanted to take the blue light away from him.
fear	fairytale_sentences	"No," said he, perceiving her evil intention, "I will not give you the light until I am standing with both feet upon the ground."
anger	fairytale_sentences	The witch fell into a passion, let him fall again into the well, and went away.
anger	fairytale_sentences	When it was ready and the soldier had taken possession of it, he summoned the little black manikin and said: "I have served the king faithfully, but he has dismissed me, and left me to hunger, and now I want to take my revenge."
anger	fairytale_sentences	"Late at night, when the king"s daughter is in bed, bring her here in her sleep, she shall do servant"s work for me."
anger	fairytale_sentences	"Aha! are you there?" cried the soldier, "get to your work at once!
anger	fairytale_sentences	Fetch the broom and sweep the chamber."
anger	fairytale_sentences	When she had done this, he ordered her to come to his chair, and then he stretched out his feet and said: "Pull off my boots," and then he threw them in her face, and made her pick them up again, and clean and brighten them.
anger	fairytale_sentences	"Do what I bid you," replied the soldier, and again this third night the princess was obliged to work like a servant, but before she went away, she hid her shoe under the bed.
anger	fairytale_sentences	"What is it?" asked the king.
anger	fairytale_sentences	"You may smoke three," answered the king, "but do not imagine that I will spare your life."
anger	fairytale_sentences	"Strike down to earth that false judge there, and his constable, and spare not the king who has treated me so ill."
anger	fairytale_sentences	Then the manikin fell on them like lightning, darting this way and that way, and whosoever was so much as touched by his cudgel fell to earth, and did not venture to stir again.
anger	fairytale_sentences	When the king saw the blood on her apron, he believed this, fell into such a passion that he ordered a high tower to be built, in which neither sun nor moon could be seen and had his wife put into it, and walled up.
anger	fairytale_sentences	Here she was to stay for seven years without meat or drink, and die of hunger.
anger	fairytale_sentences	So he went out and took the maiden aside, and said: "Tonight when the boy is asleep, go to his bed and plunge this knife into his heart, and bring me his heart and tongue, and if you do not do it, you shall lose your life."
anger	fairytale_sentences	The cook once more said: "If you do not do it, it shall cost you your own life."
anger	fairytale_sentences	Then the wicked wretch came in and said: "Where are the boy"s heart and tongue?"
anger	fairytale_sentences	Now will I pronounce thy sentence.
anger	fairytale_sentences	You shall become a black poodle and have a gold collar round your neck, and shall eat burning coals, till the flames burst forth from your throat."
anger	fairytale_sentences	But the king replied: "She let my dear son be torn to pieces by wild beasts; I will not have her named."
anger	fairytale_sentences	Thereupon he took the dog with the golden collar, and said: "That is the wretch!" and caused live coals to be brought, and these the dog was compelled to devour before the sight of all, until flames burst forth from its throat.
anger	fairytale_sentences	When the king saw him he fell into a passion, and ordered him to be cast into the deepest dungeon.
anger	fairytale_sentences	The king became very angry at this, and ordered the gardener to keep watch all night under the tree.
anger	fairytale_sentences	"If you will only listen," said the fox, "it can be done.
anger	fairytale_sentences	Then the old fox came once more, and scolded him for not following his advice; otherwise no evil would have befallen him: "Yet," said he, "I cannot leave you here, so lay hold of my tail and hold fast."
anger	fairytale_sentences	But just as the wedding was going to be solemnized, old Mr Fox stirred under the bench, and cudgelled all the rabble, and drove them and Mrs Fox out of the house.
anger	fairytale_sentences	"It will be a fine one!"
anger	fairytale_sentences	"Surely," said he, "the whole seven must have forgotten themselves over some game of play"; and when he had waited still longer and they yet did not come, he flew into a rage and wished them all turned into ravens.
anger	fairytale_sentences	When they came in, they wanted to eat and drink, and looked for their little plates and glasses.
anger	fairytale_sentences	"Who has eaten from my little plate?
anger	fairytale_sentences	And who has been drinking out of my little glass?"
anger	fairytale_sentences	Caw! well I ween Mortal lips have this way been."
anger	fairytale_sentences	"Thou hast misled me finely," said he; "I wanted to fetch the other lamb, and the country folks surprised me, and have beaten me to a jelly."
anger	fairytale_sentences	"How abominably thou hast misled me!" cried he, "the peasants caught me, and tanned my skin for me."
anger	fairytale_sentences	It came to pass that one evening he said to the king: "You think you have twelve huntsmen?"
anger	fairytale_sentences	The lion continued: "You are mistaken, they are twelve girls."
anger	fairytale_sentences	Men have a firm step, and when they walk over peas none of them stir, but girls trip and skip, and drag their feet, and the peas roll about."
anger	fairytale_sentences	The lion said: "They have been informed that they were going to be put to the test, and have assumed some strength.
anger	fairytale_sentences	The king, however, would no longer believe the lion.
anger	fairytale_sentences	"Tis not everyone would do so much for you as that.
anger	fairytale_sentences	"Some witch told you that!-- some witch told you that!" cried the little man, and dashed his right foot in a rage so deep into the floor, that he was forced to lay hold of it with both hands to pull it out.
anger	fairytale_sentences	The sight of this made the tailor so angry that he laid hold of the golden footstool, and threw it down to earth through heaven, at the old thief.
anger	fairytale_sentences	"Wilt thou contradict me again?" said the stepmother, "See that thou goest, and do not show thy face again until thou hast the basketful of strawberries!"
anger	fairytale_sentences	The maiden looked for strawberries outside, but as she found none, she went angrily home.
anger	fairytale_sentences	Then the step-mother was still more enraged, and thought of nothing but how to do every possible injury to the man"s daughter, whose beauty, however, grew daily greater.
anger	fairytale_sentences	"No!" said the lion, "nothing, unless you undertake to give me whatever meets you on your return home; if you agree to this, I will give you your life, and the rose too for your daughter."
