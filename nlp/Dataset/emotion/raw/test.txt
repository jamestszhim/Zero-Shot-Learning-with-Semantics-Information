noemo	fairytale_sentences	This is a Tale about a tail--a tail that belonged to a little red squirrel, and his name was Nutkin.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	He had a brother called Twinkleberry, and a great many cousins: they lived in a wood at the edge of a lake.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	In the middle of the lake there is an island covered with trees and nut bushes; and amongst those trees stands a hollow oak-tree, which is the house of an owl who is called Old Brown.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	One autumn when the nuts were ripe, and the leaves on the hazel bushes were golden and green-- Nutkin and Twinkleberry and all the other little squirrels came out of the wood, and down to the edge of the lake.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	They made little rafts out of twigs, and they paddled away over the water to Owl Island to gather nuts.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	Each squirrel had a little sack and a large oar, and spread out his tail for a sail.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	They also took with them an offering of three fat mice as a present for Old Brown, and put them down upon his door-step.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	Then Twinkleberry and the other little squirrels each made a low bow, and said politely--
noemo	fairytale_sentences	"Old Mr. Brown, will you favour us with permission to gather nuts upon your island?"
noemo	fairytale_sentences	But Nutkin was excessively impertinent in his manners.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	He bobbed up and down like a little red CHERRY, singing--
noemo	fairytale_sentences	"Riddle me, riddle me, rot-tot-tote!
noemo	fairytale_sentences	A little wee man, in a red red coat!
noemo	fairytale_sentences	A staff in his hand, and a stone in his throat; If you'll tell me this riddle, I'll give you a groat."
disgust	fairytale_sentences	Now this riddle is as old as the hills; Mr. Brown paid no attention whatever to Nutkin.
disgust	fairytale_sentences	He shut his eyes obstinately and went to sleep.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	The squirrels filled their little sacks with nuts, and sailed away home in the evening.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	But next morning they all came back again to Owl Island; and Twinkleberry and the others brought a fine fat mole, and laid it on the stone in front of Old Brown's doorway, and said--
noemo	fairytale_sentences	"Mr. Brown, will you favour us with your gracious permission to gather some more nuts?"
noemo	fairytale_sentences	But Nutkin, who had no respect, began to dance up and down, tickling old Mr. Brown with a NETTLE and singing--
joy	fairytale_sentences	"Old Mr. B!
joy	fairytale_sentences	Riddle-me-ree!
joy	fairytale_sentences	Hitty Pitty within the wall, Hitty Pitty without the wall; If you touch Hitty Pitty, Hitty Pitty will bite you!"
surprise	fairytale_sentences	Mr. Brown woke up suddenly and carried the mole into his house.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	Presently a little thread of blue SMOKE from a wood fire came up from the top of the tree, and Nutkin peeped through the key-hole and sang--
noemo	fairytale_sentences	"A house full, a hole full!
noemo	fairytale_sentences	And you cannot gather a bowl-full!"
noemo	fairytale_sentences	The squirrels searched for nuts all over the island and filled their little sacks.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	But Nutkin gathered oak-apples-- yellow and scarlet--and sat upon a beech-stump playing marbles, and watching the door of old Mr. Brown.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	On the third day the squirrels got up very early and went fishing; they caught seven fat minnows as a present for Old Brown.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	They paddled over the lake and landed under a crooked chestnut tree on Owl Island.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	Twinkleberry and six other little squirrels each carried a fat minnow; but Nutkin, who had no nice manners, brought no present at all.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	He ran in front, singing--
joy	fairytale_sentences	"The man in the wilderness said to me, `How may strawberries grow in the sea?'
joy	fairytale_sentences	I answered him as I thought good-- `As many red herrings as grow in the wood."'
noemo	fairytale_sentences	But old Mr. Brown took no interest in riddles--not even when the answer was provided for him.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	On the fourth day the squirrels brought a present of six fat beetles, which were as good as plums in PLUM-PUDDING for Old Brown.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	Each beetle was wrapped up carefully in a dockleaf, fastened with a pine-needle- pin.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	But Nutkin sang as rudely as ever--
joy	fairytale_sentences	"Old Mr. B! riddle-me-ree!
joy	fairytale_sentences	Flour of England, fruit of Spain, Met together in a shower of rain; Put in a bag tied round with a string, If you'll tell me this riddle, I'll give you a ring!"
noemo	fairytale_sentences	Which was ridiculous of Nutkin, because he had not got any ring to give to Old Brown.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	The other squirrels hunted up and down the nut bushes; but Nutkin gathered robin's pin-cushions off a briar bush, and stuck them full of pine-needle-pins.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	On the fifth day the squirrels brought a present of wild honey; it was so sweet and sticky that they licked their fingers as they put it down upon the stone.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	They had stolen it out of a bumble BEES' nest on the tippity top of the hill.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	But Nutkin skipped up and down, singing--
joy	fairytale_sentences	"Hum-a-bum! buzz! buzz!
joy	fairytale_sentences	Hum-a-bum buzz!
joy	fairytale_sentences	As I went over Tipple-tine I met a flock of bonny swine; Some yellow-nacked, some yellow backed!
joy	fairytale_sentences	They were the very bonniest swine That e'er went over the Tipple-tine."
disgust	fairytale_sentences	Old Mr. Brown turned up his eyes in disgust at the impertinence of Nutkin.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	But he ate up the honey!
noemo	fairytale_sentences	The squirrels filled their little sacks with nuts.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	But Nutkin sat upon a big flat rock, and played ninepins with a crab apple and green fir-cones.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	On the sixth day, which was Saturday, the squirrels came again for the last time; they brought a new-laid EGG in a little rush basket as a last parting present for Old Brown.
joy	fairytale_sentences	But Nutkin ran in front laughing, and shouting--
joy	fairytale_sentences	"Humpty Dumpty lies in the beck, With a white counterpane round his neck, Forty doctors and forty wrights, Cannot put Humpty Dumpty to rights!"
noemo	fairytale_sentences	Now old Mr. Brown took an interest in eggs; he opened one eye and shut it again.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	But still he did not speak.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	Nutkin became more and more impertinent--
joy	fairytale_sentences	"Old Mr. B!
joy	fairytale_sentences	Old Mr. B!
joy	fairytale_sentences	Hickamore, Hackamore, on the King's kitchen door; All the King's horses, and all the King's men, Couldn't drive Hickamore, Hackamore, Off the King's kitchen door!"
joy	fairytale_sentences	Nutkin danced up and down like a SUNBEAM; but still Old Brown said nothing at all.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	Nutkin began again--
joy	fairytale_sentences	"Authur O'Bower has broken his band, He comes roaring up the land!
joy	fairytale_sentences	The King of Scots with all his power, Cannot turn Arthur of the Bower!"
noemo	fairytale_sentences	Nutkin made a whirring noise to sound like the WIND, and he took a running jump right onto the head of Old Brown!
noemo	fairytale_sentences	. . .
surprise	fairytale_sentences	Then all at once there was a flutterment and a scufflement and a loud "Squeak!"
fear	fairytale_sentences	The other squirrels scuttered away into the bushes.
fear	fairytale_sentences	When they came back very cautiously, peeping round the tree-- there was Old Brown sitting on his door-step, quite still, with his eyes closed, as if nothing had happened.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	* * * * * * * *
surprise	fairytale_sentences	BUT NUTKIN WAS IN HIS WAISTCOAT POCKET!
noemo	fairytale_sentences	This looks like the end of the story; but it isn't.
anger	fairytale_sentences	And to this day, if you meet Nutkin up a tree and ask him a riddle, he will throw sticks at you, and stamp his feet and scold, and shout--
anger	fairytale_sentences	"Cuck-cuck-cuck-cur-r-r-cuck-k!"
noemo	fairytale_sentences	Once upon a time there were three little kittens, and their names were Mittens, Tom Kitten, and Moppet.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	They had dear little fur coats of their own; and they tumbled about the doorstep and played in the dust.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	But one day their mother--Mrs.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	Tabitha Twitchit--expected friends to tea; so she fetched the kittens indoors, to wash and dress them, before the fine company arrived.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	First she scrubbed their faces (this one is Moppet).
noemo	fairytale_sentences	Then she brushed their fur (this one is Mittens).
noemo	fairytale_sentences	Then she combed their tails and whiskers (this is Tom Kitten).
anger	fairytale_sentences	Tom was very naughty, and he scratched.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	Mrs. Tabitha dressed Moppet and Mittens in clean pinafores and tuckers; and then she took all sorts of elegant uncomfortable clothes out of a chest of drawers, in order to dress up her son Thomas.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	Tom Kitten was very fat, and he had grown; several buttons burst off.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	His mother sewed them on again.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	When the three kittens were ready, Mrs. Tabitha unwisely turned them out into the garden, to be out of the way while she made hot buttered toast.
anger	fairytale_sentences	"Now keep your frocks clean, children!
noemo	fairytale_sentences	You must walk on your hind legs.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	Keep away from the dirty ash- pit, and from Sally Henny Penny, and from the pigsty and the Puddle- ducks."
noemo	fairytale_sentences	Moppet and Mittens walked down the garden path unsteadily.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	Presently they trod upon their pinafores and fell on their noses.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	When they stood up there were several green smears!
noemo	fairytale_sentences	"Let us climb up the rockery and sit on the garden wall," said Moppet.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	They turned their pinafores back to front and went up with a skip and a jump; Moppet's white tucker fell down into the road.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	Tom Kitten was quite unable to jump when walking upon his hind legs in trousers.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	He came up the rockery by degrees, breaking the ferns and shedding buttons right and left.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	He was all in pieces when he reached the top of the wall.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	Moppet and Mittens tried to pull him together; his hat fell off, and the rest of his buttons burst.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	While they were in difficulties, there was a pit pat, paddle pat! and the three Puddle-ducks came along the hard high road, marching one behind the other and doing the goose step-- pit pat, paddle pat! pit pat, waddle pat!
noemo	fairytale_sentences	They stopped and stood in a row and stared up at the kittens.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	Then the two duck-birds, Rebeccah and Jemima Puddle-duck, picked up the hat and tucker and put them on.
joy	fairytale_sentences	Mittens laughed so that she fell off the wall.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	Moppet and Tom descended after her; the pinafores and all the rest of Tom's clothes came off on the way down.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	"Come!
noemo	fairytale_sentences	Mr. Drake Puddle-duck," said Moppet.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	"Come and help us to dress him!
noemo	fairytale_sentences	Come and button up Tom!"
noemo	fairytale_sentences	Mr. Drake Puddle-duck advanced in a slow sideways manner and picked up the various articles.
surprise	fairytale_sentences	But he put them on HIMSELF!
noemo	fairytale_sentences	They fitted him even worse than Tom Kitten.
joy	fairytale_sentences	"It's a very fine morning!" said Mr. Drake Puddle-duck.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	And he and Jemima and Rebeccah Puddle-duck set off up the road, keeping step--pit pat, paddle pat! pit pat, waddle pat!
noemo	fairytale_sentences	Then Tabitha Twitchit came down the garden and found her kittens on the wall with no clothes on.
anger	fairytale_sentences	She pulled them off the wall, smacked them, and took them back to the house.
anger	fairytale_sentences	"My friends will arrive in a minute, and you are not fit to be seen; I am affronted," said Mrs. Tabitha Twitchit.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	She sent them upstairs; and I am sorry to say she told her friends that they were in bed with the measles-- which was not true.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	Quite the contrary; they were not in bed: NOT in the least.
disgust	fairytale_sentences	Somehow there were very extra-- ordinary noises overhead, which disturbed the dignity and repose of the tea party.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	And I think that some day I shall have to make another, larger book, to tell you more about Tom Kitten!
noemo	fairytale_sentences	As for the Puddle-ducks--they went into a pond.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	The clothes all came off directly, because there were no buttons.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	And Mr. Drake Puddle-duck, and Jemima and Rebeccah, have been looking for them ever since.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	Once upon a time there was a woodmouse, and her name was Mrs. Tittlemouse.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	She lived in a bank under a hedge.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	Such a funny house!
noemo	fairytale_sentences	There were yards and yards of sandy passages, leading to store- rooms and nut cellars and seed cellars, all amongst the roots of the hedge.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	There was a kitchen, a parlor, a pantry, and a larder.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	Also, there was Mrs. Tittle- mouse's bedroom, where she slept in a little box bed!
noemo	fairytale_sentences	Mrs. Tittlemouse was a most terribly tidy particular little mouse, always sweeping and dusting the soft sandy floors.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	Sometimes a beetle lost its way in the passages.
disgust	fairytale_sentences	"Shuh! shuh! little dirty feet!" said Mrs. Tittlemouse, clattering her dustpan.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	And one day a little old woman ran up and down in a red spotty cloak.
surprise	fairytale_sentences	"Your house is on fire, Mother Ladybird!
surprise	fairytale_sentences	Fly away home to your children!"
noemo	fairytale_sentences	Another day, a big fat spider came in to shelter from the rain.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	"Beg pardon, is this not Miss Muffet's?"
disgust	fairytale_sentences	Leaving ends of cobweb all over my nice clean house!"
noemo	fairytale_sentences	She bundled the spider out at a window.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	He let himself down the hedge with a long thin bit of string.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	Mrs. Tittlemouse went on her way to a distant storeroom, to fetch cherrystones and thistle- down seed for dinner.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	All along the passage she sniffed, and looked at the floor.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	"I smell a smell of honey; is it the cowslips outside, in the hedge?
disgust	fairytale_sentences	I am sure I can see the marks of little dirty feet."
joy	fairytale_sentences	Suddenly round a corner, she met Babbitty Bumble--"Zizz, Bizz, Bizzz!" said the bumble bee.
sadness	fairytale_sentences	She wished that she had a broom.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	"Good-day, Babbitty Bumble; I should be glad to buy some bees- wax.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	But what are you doing down here?
disgust	fairytale_sentences	Why do you always come in at a window, and say, Zizz, Bizz, Bizzz?"
anger	fairytale_sentences	Mrs. Tittle- mouse began to get cross.
anger	fairytale_sentences	"Zizz, Wizz, Wizzz!" replied Babbitty Bumble in a peevish squeak.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	She sidled down a passage, and disappeared into a storeroom which had been used for acorns.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	Mrs. Tittlemouse had eaten the acorns before Christmas; the storeroom ought to have been empty.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	But it was full of untidy dry moss.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	Mrs. Tittlemouse began to pull out the moss.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	Three or four other bees put their heads out, and buzzed fiercely.
anger	fairytale_sentences	"I am not in the habit of letting lodgings; this is an intrusion!" said Mrs. Tittlemouse.
anger	fairytale_sentences	"I will have them turned out --" "Buzz!
noemo	fairytale_sentences	Buzz!
noemo	fairytale_sentences	Buzzz!"--"I wonder who would help me?"
noemo	fairytale_sentences	"Bizz, Wizz, Wizzz!"
noemo	fairytale_sentences	--"I will not have Mr. Jackson; he never wipes his feet."
noemo	fairytale_sentences	Mrs. Tittlemouse decided to leave the bees till after dinner.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	When she got back to the parlor, she heard some one coughing in a fat voice; and there sat Mr. Jackson himself.
joy	fairytale_sentences	He was sitting all over a small rocking chair, twiddling his thumbs and smiling, with his feet on the fender.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	He lived in a drain below the hedge, in a very dirty wet ditch.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	"How do you do, Mr. Jackson?
surprise	fairytale_sentences	Deary me, you have got very wet!"
joy	fairytale_sentences	"Thank you, thank you, thank you, Mrs. Tittlemouse!
noemo	fairytale_sentences	I'll sit awhile and dry myself," said Mr. Jackson.
joy	fairytale_sentences	He sat and smiled, and the water dripped off his coat tails.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	Mrs. Tittlemouse went round with a mop.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	He sat such a while that he had to be asked if he would take some dinner?
noemo	fairytale_sentences	First she offered him cherry- stones.
joy	fairytale_sentences	"Thank you, thank you, Mrs. Tittlemouse!
noemo	fairytale_sentences	No teeth, no teeth, no teeth!" said Mr. Jackson.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	He opened his mouth most unnecessarily wide; he certainly had not a tooth in his head.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	Then she offered him thistle- down seed--"Tiddly, widdly, widdly!
noemo	fairytale_sentences	Pouff, pouff, puff." said Mr. Jackson.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	He blew the thistle- down all over the room.
joy	fairytale_sentences	"Thank you, thank you, thank you, Mrs. Tittlemouse!
joy	fairytale_sentences	Now what I really--REALLY should like-- would be a little dish of honey!"
sadness	fairytale_sentences	"I am afraid I have not got any, Mr. Jackson!" said Mrs. Tittlemouse.
joy	fairytale_sentences	"Tiddly, widdly, widdly, Mrs. Tittlemouse!" said the smiling Mr. Jackson, "I can SMELL it; that is why I came to call."
noemo	fairytale_sentences	Mr. Jackson rose ponderously from the table, and began to look into the cupboards.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	Mrs. Tittlemouse followed him with a dishcloth, to wipe his large wet footmarks off the parlor floor.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	When he had convinced himself that there was no honey in the cupboards, he began to walk down the passage.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	"Indeed, indeed, you will stick fast, Mr. Jackson!"
noemo	fairytale_sentences	"Tiddly, widdly, widdly, Mrs. Tittlemouse!"
noemo	fairytale_sentences	First he squeezed into the pantry.
surprise	fairytale_sentences	"Tiddly, widdly, widdly?
surprise	fairytale_sentences	No honey?
surprise	fairytale_sentences	No honey, Mrs. Tittlemouse?"
noemo	fairytale_sentences	There were three creepy-crawly people hiding in the plate rack.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	Two of them got away; but the littlest one he caught.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	Then he squeezed into the larder.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	Miss Butterfly was tasting the sugar; but she flew away out of the window.
surprise	fairytale_sentences	"Tiddly, widdly, widdly, Mrs. Tittlemouse; you seem to have plenty of visitors!"
disgust	fairytale_sentences	"And without any invitation!" said Mrs. Thomasina Tittlemouse.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	They went along the sandy passage--"Tiddly, widdly--" "Buzz!
noemo	fairytale_sentences	Wizz!
noemo	fairytale_sentences	Wizz!"
noemo	fairytale_sentences	He met Babbitty round a corner, and snapped her up, and put her down again.
disgust	fairytale_sentences	"I do not like bumble bees.
disgust	fairytale_sentences	They are all over bristles," said Mr. Jackson, wiping his mouth with his coat sleeve.
anger	fairytale_sentences	"Get out, you nasty old toad!" shrieked Babbitty Bumble.
anger	fairytale_sentences	"I shall go distracted!" scolded Mrs. Tittlemouse.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	She shut herself up in the nut cellar while Mr. Jackson pulled out the bees-nest.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	He seemed to have no objection to stings.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	When Mrs. Tittlemouse ventured to come out--everybody had gone away.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	She gathered up the moss and the remains of the bees- wax.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	Then she went out and fetched some twigs, to partly close up the front door.
anger	fairytale_sentences	"I will make it too small for Mr. Jackson!"
noemo	fairytale_sentences	She fetched soft soap, and flannel, and a new scrubbing brush from the storeroom.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	But she was too tired to do any more.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	First she fell asleep in her chair, and then she went to bed.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	Next morning she got up very early and began a spring cleaning which lasted a fort- night.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	She swept, and scrubbed, and dusted; and she rubbed up the furniture with bees- wax, and polished her little tin spoons.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	When it was all beautifully neat and clean, she gave a party to five other little mice, without Mr. Jackson.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	He smelt the party and came up the bank, but he could not squeeze in at the door.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	So they handed him out acorn cupfuls of honeydew through the window, and he was not at all offended.
joy	fairytale_sentences	He sat outside in the sun, and said--"Tiddly, widdly, widdly!
joy	fairytale_sentences	Your very good health, Mrs. Tittlemouse!"
noemo	fairytale_sentences	Once upon a time there was an old cat, called Mrs. Tabitha Twitchit, who was an anxious parent.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	She used to lose her kittens continually, and whenever they were lost they were always in mischief!
noemo	fairytale_sentences	On baking day she determined to shut them up in a cupboard.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	She caught Moppet and Mittens, but she could not find Tom.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	Mrs. Tabitha went up and down all over the house, mewing for Tom Kitten.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	She looked in the pantry under the staircase, and she searched the best spare bedroom that was all covered up with dust sheets.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	She went right upstairs and looked into the attics, but she could not find him anywhere.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	It was an old, old house, full of cupboards and passages.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	Some of the walls were four feet thick, and there used to be queer noises inside them, as if there might be a little secret staircase.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	Certainly there were odd little jagged doorways in the wainscot, and things disappeared at night-- especially cheese and bacon.
fear	fairytale_sentences	Mrs. Tabitha became more and more distracted and mewed dreadfully.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	While their mother was searching the house, Moppet and Mittens had got into mischief.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	The cupboard door was not locked, so they pushed it open and came out.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	They went straight to the dough which was set to rise in a pan before the fire.
joy	fairytale_sentences	They patted it with their little soft paws--"Shall we make dear little muffins?" said Mittens to Moppet.
fear	fairytale_sentences	But just at that moment somebody knocked at the front door, and Moppet jumped into the flour barrel in a fright.
fear	fairytale_sentences	Mittens ran away to the dairy and hid in an empty jar on the stone shelf where the milk pans stand.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	The visitor was a neighbor, Mrs. Ribby; she had called to borrow some yeast.
sadness	fairytale_sentences	I'm in sad trouble, Cousin Ribby," said Tabitha, shedding tears.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	Where have you looked for him?"
sadness	fairytale_sentences	"All over the house!
sadness	fairytale_sentences	The rats are too many for me.
anger	fairytale_sentences	What a thing it is to have an unruly family!" said Mrs. Tabitha Twitchit.
anger	fairytale_sentences	"I'm not afraid of rats; I will help you to find him; and whip him, too!
noemo	fairytale_sentences	What is all that soot in the fender?"
surprise	fairytale_sentences	"The chimney wants sweeping-- Oh, dear me, Cousin Ribby--now Moppet and Mittens are gone!
surprise	fairytale_sentences	"They have both got out of the cupboard!"
noemo	fairytale_sentences	Ribby and Tabitha set to work to search the house thoroughly again.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	They poked under the beds with Ribby's umbrella and they rummaged in cupboards.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	They even fetched a candle and looked inside a clothes chest in one of the attics.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	They could not find anything, but once they heard a door bang and somebody scuttered downstairs.
sadness	fairytale_sentences	"Yes, it is infested with rats," said Tabitha tearfully.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	"I caught seven young ones out of one hole in the back kitchen, and we had them for dinner last Saturday.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	And once I saw the old father rat--an enormous old rat-- Cousin Ribby.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	I was just going to jump upon him, when he showed his yellow teeth at me and whisked down the hole.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	Ribby and Tabitha searched and searched.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	They both heard a curious roly-poly noise under the attic floor.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	But there was nothing to be seen.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	They returned to the kitchen.
surprise	fairytale_sentences	"Here's one of your kittens at least," said Ribby, dragging Moppet out of the flour barrel.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	They shook the flour off her and set her down on the kitchen floor.
fear	fairytale_sentences	She seemed to be in a terrible fright.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	The two cats ran to look at the dough pan.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	Sure enough there were marks of little scratching fingers, and a lump of dough was gone!
noemo	fairytale_sentences	"Which way did she go, Moppet?"
fear	fairytale_sentences	But Moppet had been too much frightened to peep out of the barrel again.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	Ribby and Tabitha took her with them to keep her safely in sight, while they went on with their search.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	They went into the dairy.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	The first thing they found was Mittens, hiding in an empty jar.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	They tipped over the jar, and she scrambled out.
fear	fairytale_sentences	"Oh, Mother, Mother!" said Mittens--
fear	fairytale_sentences	"Oh!
noemo	fairytale_sentences	Ribby and Tabitha looked at one another.
surprise	fairytale_sentences	"A rolling pin and butter!
fear	fairytale_sentences	Oh, my poor son Thomas!" exclaimed Tabitha, wringing her paws.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	"A rolling pin?" said Ribby.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	"Did we not hear a roly-poly noise in the attic when we were looking into that chest?"
noemo	fairytale_sentences	Ribby and Tabitha rushed upstairs again.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	Sure enough the roly-poly noise was still going on quite distinctly under the attic floor.
fear	fairytale_sentences	"This is serious, Cousin Tabitha," said Ribby.
fear	fairytale_sentences	"We must send for John Joiner at once, with a saw."
noemo	fairytale_sentences	Now, this is what had been happening to Tom Kitten, and it shows how very unwise it is to go up a chimney in a very old house, where a person does not know his way, and where there are enormous rats.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	Tom Kitten did not want to be shut up in a cupboard.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	When he saw that his mother was going to bake, he determined to hide.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	He looked about for a nice convenient place, and he fixed upon the chimney.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	The fire had only just been lighted, and it was not hot; but there was a white choky smoke from the green sticks.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	Tom Kitten got upon the fender and looked up.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	It was a big old- fashioned fireplace.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	The chimney itself was wide enough inside for a man to stand up and walk about.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	So there was plenty of room for a little Tom Cat.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	He jumped right up into the fireplace, balancing himself upon the iron bar where the kettle hangs.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	Tom Kitten took another big jump off the bar and landed on a ledge high up inside the chimney, knocking down some soot into the fender.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	Tom Kitten coughed and choked with the smoke; he could hear the sticks beginning to crackle and burn in the fireplace down below.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	He made up his mind to climb right to the top, and get out on the slates, and try to catch sparrows.
fear	fairytale_sentences	"I cannot go back.
fear	fairytale_sentences	If I slipped I might fall in the fire and singe my beautiful tail and my little blue jacket."
noemo	fairytale_sentences	The chimney was a very big old- fashioned one.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	It was built in the days when people burnt logs of wood upon the hearth.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	The chimney stack stood up above the roof like a little stone tower, and the daylight shone down from the top, under the slanting slates that kept out the rain.
fear	fairytale_sentences	Tom Kitten was getting very frightened!
noemo	fairytale_sentences	He climbed up, and up, and up.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	Then he waded sideways through inches of soot.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	He was like a little sweep himself.
fear	fairytale_sentences	It was most confusing in the dark.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	One flue seemed to lead into another.
fear	fairytale_sentences	There was less smoke, but Tom Kitten felt quite lost.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	He scrambled up and up; but before he reached the chimney top he came to a place where somebody had loosened a stone in the wall.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	There were some mutton bones lying about.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	"This seems funny," said Tom Kitten.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	"Who has been gnawing bones up here in the chimney?
fear	fairytale_sentences	I wish I had never come!
fear	fairytale_sentences	And what a funny smell?
fear	fairytale_sentences	It is something like mouse, only dreadfully strong.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	It makes me sneeze," said Tom Kitten.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	He squeezed through the hole in the wall and dragged himself along a most uncomfortably tight passage where there was scarcely any light.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	He groped his way carefully for several yards; he was at the back of the skirting board in the attic, where there is a little mark * in the picture.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	All at once he fell head over heels in the dark, down a hole, and landed on a heap of very dirty rags.
surprise	fairytale_sentences	When Tom Kitten picked himself up and looked about him, he found himself in a place that he had never seen before, although he had lived all his life in the house.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	It was a very small stuffy fusty room, with boards, and rafters, and cobwebs, and lath and plaster.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	Opposite to him--as far away as he could sit--was an enormous rat.
anger	fairytale_sentences	"What do you mean by tumbling into my bed all covered with smuts?" said the rat, chattering his teeth.
fear	fairytale_sentences	"Please, sir, the chimney wants sweeping," said poor Tom Kitten.
anger	fairytale_sentences	"Anna Maria!
anger	fairytale_sentences	Anna Maria!" squeaked the rat.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	There was a pattering noise and an old woman rat poked her head round a rafter.
surprise	fairytale_sentences	All in a minute she rushed upon Tom Kitten, and before he knew what was happening.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	. .
noemo	fairytale_sentences	. . . his coat was pulled off, and he was rolled up in a bundle, and tied with string in very hard knots.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	Anna Maria did the tying.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	The old rat watched her and took snuff.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	When she had finished, they both sat staring at him with their mouths open.
joy	fairytale_sentences	"Anna Maria," said the old man rat (whose name was Samuel Whiskers), "Anna Maria, make me a kitten dumpling roly-poly pudding for my dinner."
noemo	fairytale_sentences	"It requires dough and a pat of butter and a rolling pin," said Anna Maria, considering Tom Kitten with her head on one side.
anger	fairytale_sentences	"No," said Samuel Whiskers, "make it properly, Anna Maria, with breadcrumbs."
anger	fairytale_sentences	Butter and dough," replied Anna Maria.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	The two rats consulted together for a few minutes and then went away.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	Samuel Whiskers got through a hole in the wainscot and went boldly down the front staircase to the dairy to get the butter.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	He did not meet anybody.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	He made a second journey for the rolling pin.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	He pushed it in front of him with his paws, like a brewer's man trundling a barrel.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	He could hear Ribby and Tabitha talking, but they were too busy lighting the candle to look into the chest.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	They did not see him.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	Anna Maria went down by way of skirting board and a window shutter to the kitchen to steal the dough.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	She borrowed a small saucer and scooped up the dough with her paws.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	She did not observe Moppet.
fear	fairytale_sentences	While Tom Kitten was left alone under the floor of the attic, he wriggled about and tried to mew for help.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	But his mouth was full of soot and cobwebs, and he was tied up in such very tight knots, he could not make anybody hear him.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	Except a spider who came out of a crack in the ceiling and examined the knots critically, from a safe distance.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	It was a judge of knots because it had a habit of tying up unfortunate bluebottles.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	It did not offer to assist him.
fear	fairytale_sentences	Tom Kitten wriggled and squirmed until he was quite exhausted.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	Presently the rats came back and set to work to make him into a dumpling.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	First they smeared him with butter, and then they rolled him in the dough.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	"Will not the string be very indigestible, Anna Maria?" inquired Samuel Whiskers.
anger	fairytale_sentences	Anna Maria said she thought that it was of no consequence; but she wished that Tom Kitten would hold his head still, as it disarranged the pastry.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	She laid hold of his ears.
anger	fairytale_sentences	Tom Kitten bit and spit, and mewed and wriggled; and the rolling pin went roly-poly, roly; roly-poly, roly.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	The rats each held an end.
disgust	fairytale_sentences	"His tail is sticking out!
disgust	fairytale_sentences	You did not fetch enough dough, Anna Maria."
anger	fairytale_sentences	"I fetched as much as I could carry," replied Anna Maria.
anger	fairytale_sentences	"I do not think"--said Samuel Whiskers, pausing to take a look at Tom Kitten--"I do NOT think it will be a good pudding.
disgust	fairytale_sentences	It smells sooty."
surprise	fairytale_sentences	Anna Maria was about to argue the point when all at once there began to be other sounds up above--the rasping noise of a saw, and the noise of a little dog, scratching and yelping!
fear	fairytale_sentences	"We are discovered and interrupted, Anna Maria; let us collect our property--and other people's--and depart at once.
sadness	fairytale_sentences	"I fear that we shall be obliged to leave this pudding.
disgust	fairytale_sentences	"But I am persuaded that the knots would have proved indigestible, whatever you may urge to the contrary."
noemo	fairytale_sentences	"Come away at once and help me to tie up some mutton bones in a counterpane," said Anna Maria.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	"I have got half a smoked ham hidden in the chimney."
noemo	fairytale_sentences	So it happened that by the time John Joiner had got the plank up-- there was nobody here under the floor except the rolling pin and Tom Kitten in a very dirty dumpling!
anger	fairytale_sentences	But there was a strong smell of rats; and John Joiner spent the rest of the morning sniffing and whining, and wagging his tail, and going round and round with his head in the hole like a gimlet.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	Then he nailed the plank down again and put his tools in his bag, and came downstairs.
joy	fairytale_sentences	The cat family had quite recovered.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	They invited him to stay to dinner.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	The dumpling had been peeled off Tom Kitten and made separately into a bag pudding, with currants in it to hide the smuts.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	They had been obliged to put Tom Kitten into a hot bath to get the butter off.
sadness	fairytale_sentences	John Joiner smelt the pudding; but he regretted that he had not time to stay to dinner, because he had just finished making a wheelbarrow for Miss Potter, and she had ordered two hen coops.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	And when I was going to the post late in the afternoon--I looked up the land from the corner, and I saw Mr. Samuel Whiskers and his wife on the run, with big bundles on a little wheelbarrow, which looked very much like mine.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	They were just turning in at the gate to the barn of Farmer Potatoes.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	Samuel Whiskers was puffing and out of breath.
anger	fairytale_sentences	Anna Maria was still arguing in shrill tones.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	She seemed to know her way, and she seemed to have a quantity of luggage.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	I am sure _I_ never gave her leave to borrow my wheelbarrow!
noemo	fairytale_sentences	They went into the barn and hauled their parcels with a bit of string to the top of the haymow.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	After that, there were no more rats for a long time at Tabitha Twitchit's.
anger	fairytale_sentences	As for Farmer Potatoes, he has been driven nearly distracted.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	There are rats, and rats, and rats in his barn!
noemo	fairytale_sentences	They eat up the chicken food, and steal the oats and bran, and make holes in the meal bags.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	And they are all descended from Mr. and Mrs. Samuel Whiskers-- children and grandchildren and great-great-grandchildren.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	There is no end to them!
noemo	fairytale_sentences	Moppet and Mittens have grown up into very good rat-catchers.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	They go out rat-catching in the village, and they find plenty of employment.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	They charge so much a dozen and earn their living very comfortably.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	They hang up the rats' tails in a row on the barn door, to show how many they have caught--dozens and dozens of them.
fear	fairytale_sentences	But Tom Kitten has always been afraid of a rat; he never durst face anything that is bigger than--
noemo	fairytale_sentences	A Mouse.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	Once upon a time there was a village shop.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	The name over the window was "Ginger and Pickles."
noemo	fairytale_sentences	It was a little small shop just the right size for Dolls-- Lucinda and Jane Doll-cook always bought their groceries at Ginger and Pickles.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	The counter inside was a convenient height for rabbits.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	Ginger and Pickles sold red spotty pocket handkerchiefs at a penny three farthings.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	They also sold sugar, and snuff and galoshes.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	In fact, although it was such a small shop it sold nearly everything--except a few things that you want in a hurry--like bootlaces, hair- pins and mutton chops.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	Ginger and Pickles were the people who kept the shop.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	Ginger was a yellow tomcat, and Pickles was a terrier.
fear	fairytale_sentences	The rabbits were always a little bit afraid of Pickles.
fear	fairytale_sentences	The shop was also patronized by mice--only the mice were rather afraid of Ginger.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	Ginger usually requested Pickles to serve them, because he said it made his mouth water.
disgust	fairytale_sentences	"I cannot bear," said he, "to see them going out at the door carrying their little parcels."
noemo	fairytale_sentences	"I have the same feeling about rats," replied Pickles, "but it would never do to eat our customers; they would leave us and go to Tabitha Twitchit's."
sadness	fairytale_sentences	"On the contrary, they would go nowhere," replied Ginger gloomily.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	(Tabitha Twitchit kept the only other shop in the village.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	She did not give credit.)
noemo	fairytale_sentences	But there is no money in what is called the "till."
noemo	fairytale_sentences	Ginger and Pickles gave unlimited credit.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	Now the meaning of "credit" is this--when a customer buys a bar of soap, instead of the customer pulling out a purse and paying for it --she says she will pay another time.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	And Pickles makes a low bow and says, "With pleasure, madam," and it is written down in a book.
fear	fairytale_sentences	The customers come again and again, and buy quantities, in spite of being afraid of Ginger and Pickles.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	The customers came in crowds every day and bought quantities, especially the toffee customers.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	But there was always no money; they never paid for as much as a penny- worth of peppermints.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	But the sales were enormous, ten times as large as Tabitha Twitchit's.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	As there was always no money, Ginger and Pickles were obliged to eat their own goods.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	Pickles ate biscuits and Ginger ate a dried haddock.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	They ate them by candle- light after the shop was closed.
fear	fairytale_sentences	"It is very uncomfortable, I am afraid I shall be summoned.
sadness	fairytale_sentences	I have tried in vain to get a license upon credit at the Post Office;" said Pickles.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	"The place is full of policemen.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	I met one as I was coming home.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	"Let us send in the bill again to Samuel Whiskers, Ginger, he owes 22/9 for bacon."
noemo	fairytale_sentences	"I do not believe that he intends to pay at all," replied Ginger.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	When it came to Jan. 1st there was still no money, and Pickles was unable to buy a dog license.
fear	fairytale_sentences	"It is very unpleasant, I am afraid of the police," said Pickles.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	"It is your own fault for being a terrier; _I_ do not require a license, and neither does Kep, the Collie dog."
disgust	fairytale_sentences	"And I feel sure that Anna Maria pockets things--
noemo	fairytale_sentences	"Where are all the cream crackers?"
noemo	fairytale_sentences	"You have eaten them yourself." replied Ginger.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	Ginger and Pickles retired into the back parlor.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	They did accounts.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	They added up sums and sums, and sums.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	"Samuel Whiskers has run up a bill as long as his tail; he has had an ounce and three- quarters of snuff since October.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	"What is seven pounds of butter at 1/3, and a stick of sealing wax and four matches?"
noemo	fairytale_sentences	"Send in all the bills again to everybody `with compliments,'" replied Ginger.
anger	fairytale_sentences	Pickles nearly had a fit, he barked and he barked and made little rushes.
anger	fairytale_sentences	"Bite him, Pickles! bite him!" spluttered Ginger behind a sugar barrel, "he's only a German doll!"
noemo	fairytale_sentences	The policeman went on writing in his notebook; twice he put his pencil in his mouth, and once he dipped it in the treacle.
anger	fairytale_sentences	Pickles barked till he was hoarse.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	But still the policeman took no notice.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	He had bead eyes, and his helmet was sewed on with stitches.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	After a time they heard a noise in the shop, as if something had been pushed in at the door.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	They came out of the back parlor.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	There was an envelope lying on the counter, and a policeman writing in a notebook!
noemo	fairytale_sentences	At length on his last little rush--Pickles found that the shop was empty.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	The policeman had disappeared.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	But the envelope remained.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	"Do you think that he has gone to fetch a real live policeman?
fear	fairytale_sentences	I am afraid it is a summons," said Pickles.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	"No," replied Ginger, who had opened the envelope, "it is the rates and taxes, 3 pounds 19 11 3/4." [pounds are British money, the 19 is schillings, and then pence]
noemo	fairytale_sentences	They put up the shutters, and left.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	But they have not removed from the neighborhood.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	In fact some people wish they had gone further.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	Ginger is living in the warren [game preserve for rabbits].
noemo	fairytale_sentences	I do not know what occupation he pursues; he looks stout and comfortable.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	Pickles is at present a game- keeper.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	After a time Mr. John Dormouse and his daughter began to sell peppermints and candles.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	But they did not keep "self- fitting sixes"; and it takes five mice to carry one seven inch candle.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	The closing of the shop caused great inconvenience.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	Tabitha Twitchit immediately raised the price of everything a halfpenny; and she continued to refuse to give credit.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	Of course there are the tradesmen's carts--the butcher, the fishman and Timothy Baker.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	But a person cannot live on "seed wigs" and sponge cake and butter buns--not even when the sponge cake is as good as Timothy's!
noemo	fairytale_sentences	And Miss Dormouse refused to take back the ends when they were brought back to her with complaints.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	And when Mr. John Dormouse was complained to, he stayed in bed, and would say nothing but "very snug;" which is not the way to carry on a retail business.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	Besides--the candles which they sell behave very strangely in warm weather.
joy	fairytale_sentences	So everybody was pleased when Sally Henny Penny sent out a printed poster to say that she was going to reopen the shop--"Henny's Opening Sale!
noemo	fairytale_sentences	Grand cooperative Jumble!
noemo	fairytale_sentences	Penny's penny prices!
noemo	fairytale_sentences	Come buy, come try, come buy!"
noemo	fairytale_sentences	The poster really was most 'ticing.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	There was a rush upon the opening day.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	The shop was crammed with customers, and there were crowds of mice upon the biscuit cannisters.
anger	fairytale_sentences	Sally Henny Penny gets rather flustered when she tries to count out change, and she insists on being paid cash; but she is quite harmless.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	And she has laid in a remarkable assortment of bargains.
joy	fairytale_sentences	There is something to please everybody.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	Once upon a time there was a little fat comfortable grey squirrel, called Timmy Tiptoes.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	He had a nest thatched with leaves in the top of a tall tree; and he had a little squirrel wife called Goody.
joy	fairytale_sentences	Timmy Tiptoes sat out, enjoying the breeze; he whisked his tail and chuckled--"Little wife Goody, the nuts are ripe; we must lay up a store for winter and spring."
noemo	fairytale_sentences	Goody Tiptoes was busy pushing moss under the thatch--"The nest is so snug, we shall be sound asleep all winter."
noemo	fairytale_sentences	"Then we shall wake up all the thinner, when there is nothing to eat in spring- time," replied prudent Timothy.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	When Timmy and Goody Tiptoes came to the nut thicket, they found other squirrels were there already.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	Timmy took off his jacket and hung it on a twig; they worked away quietly by themselves.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	Every day they made several journeys and picked quantities of nuts.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	They carried them away in bags, and stored them in several hollow stumps near the tree where they had built their nest.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	When these stumps were full, they began to empty the bags into a hole high up a tree, that had belonged to a woodpecker; the nuts rattled down--down--down inside.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	"How shall you ever get them out again?
surprise	fairytale_sentences	It is like a money box!" said Goody.
joy	fairytale_sentences	"I shall be much thinner before springtime, my love," said Timmy Tiptoes, peeping into the hole.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	They did collect quantities-- because they did not lose them!
noemo	fairytale_sentences	Squirrels who bury their nuts in the ground lose more than half, because they cannot remember the place.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	The most forgetful squirrel in the wood was called Silvertail.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	He began to dig, and he could not remember.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	And then he dug again and found some nuts that did not belong to him; and there was a fight.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	And other squirrels began to dig,--the whole wood was in commotion!
noemo	fairytale_sentences	Unfortunately, just at this time a flock of little birds flew by, from bush to bush, searching for green caterpillars and spiders.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	There were several sorts of little birds, twittering different songs.
anger	fairytale_sentences	The first one sang--"Who's bin digging-up MY nuts?
anger	fairytale_sentences	Who's-been- digging-up MY nuts?"
anger	fairytale_sentences	And another sang--"Little bita bread and-NO-cheese!
anger	fairytale_sentences	Little bit-a- bread an'-NO-cheese!"
noemo	fairytale_sentences	The squirrels followed and listened.
anger	fairytale_sentences	The first little bird flew into the bush where Timmy and Goody Tiptoes were quietly tying up their bags, and it sang--"Who's-bin digging-up MY nuts?
anger	fairytale_sentences	Who's been digging-up MY-nuts?"
noemo	fairytale_sentences	Timmy Tiptoes went on with his work without replying; indeed, the little bird did not expect an answer.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	It was only singing its natural song, and it meant nothing at all.
anger	fairytale_sentences	But when the other squirrels heard that song, they rushed upon Timmy Tiptoes and cuffed and scratched him, and upset his bag of nuts.
fear	fairytale_sentences	The innocent little bird which had caused all the mischief, flew away in a fright!
anger	fairytale_sentences	Timmy rolled over and over, and then turned tail and fled towards his nest, followed by a crowd of squirrels shouting-- "Who's-been digging-up MY-nuts?"
noemo	fairytale_sentences	They caught him and dragged him up the very same tree, where there was the little round hole, and they pushed him in.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	The hole was much too small for Timmy Tiptoes' figure.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	They squeezed him dreadfully, it was a wonder they did not break his ribs.
anger	fairytale_sentences	"We will leave him here till he confesses," said Silvertail Squirrel and he shouted into the hole--"Who's- been-digging-up MY-nuts?"
noemo	fairytale_sentences	Timmy Tiptoes made no reply; he had tumbled down inside the tree, upon half a peck of nuts belonging to himself.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	Goody Tiptoes picked up the nut bags and went home.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	She made a cup of tea for Timmy; but he didn't come and didn't come.
fear	fairytale_sentences	Goody Tiptoes passed a lonely and unhappy night.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	Next morning she ventured back to the nut bushes to look for him; but the other unkind squirrels drove her away.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	She wandered all over the wood, calling--
sadness	fairytale_sentences	"Timmy Tiptoes!
sadness	fairytale_sentences	Timmy Tip- toes!
sadness	fairytale_sentences	Oh, where is Timmy Tiptoes?"
noemo	fairytale_sentences	In the meantime Timmy Tiptoes came to his senses.
sadness	fairytale_sentences	Timmy coughed and groaned, because his ribs hurted him.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	There was a chirpy noise, and a small striped Chipmunk appeared with a night light, and hoped he felt better?
joy	fairytale_sentences	It was most kind to Timmy Tiptoes; it lent him its nightcap; and the house was full of provisions.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	The Chipmunk explained that it had rained nuts through the top of the tree--"Besides, I found a few buried!"
joy	fairytale_sentences	It laughed and chuckled when it heard Timmy's story.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	While Timmy was confined to bed, it 'ticed him to eat quantities --"But how shall I ever get out through that hole unless I thin myself?
fear	fairytale_sentences	My wife will be anxious!"
noemo	fairytale_sentences	"Just another nut--or two nuts; let me crack them for you," said the Chipmunk.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	Timmy Tiptoes grew fatter and fatter!
noemo	fairytale_sentences	Now Goody Tiptoes had set to work again by herself.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	She did not put any more nuts into the woodpecker's hole, because she had always doubted how they could be got out again.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	She hid them under a tree root; they rattled down, down, down.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	Once when Goody emptied an extra big bagful, there was a decided squeak; and next time Goody brought another bagful, a little striped Chipmunk scrambled out in a hurry.
sadness	fairytale_sentences	"It is getting perfectly full-up downstairs; the sitting room is full, and they are rolling along the passage; and my husband, Chippy Hackee, has run away and left me.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	What is the explanation of these showers of nuts?"
noemo	fairytale_sentences	"I am sure I beg your pardon; I did not know that anybody lived here," said Mrs. Goody Tiptoes; "but where is Chippy Hackee?
sadness	fairytale_sentences	My husband, Timmy Tiptoes, has run away too."
noemo	fairytale_sentences	"I know where Chippy is; a little bird told me," said Mrs. Chippy Hackee.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	She led the way to the woodpecker's tree, and they listened at the hole.
joy	fairytale_sentences	Down below there was a noise of nutcrackers, and a fat squirrel voice and a thin squirrel voice were singing together--
noemo	fairytale_sentences	"My little old man and I fell out, How shall we bring this matter about?
noemo	fairytale_sentences	Bring it about as well as you can, And get you gone, you little old man!"
noemo	fairytale_sentences	"You could squeeze in, through that little round hole," said Goody Tiptoes.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	"Yes, I could," said the Chipmunk, "but my husband, Chippy Hackee, bites!"
noemo	fairytale_sentences	Down below there was a noise of cracking nuts and nibbling; and then the fat squirrel voice and the thin squirrel voice sang--
noemo	fairytale_sentences	"For the diddlum day Day diddle durn di!
noemo	fairytale_sentences	Day diddle diddle dum day!"
noemo	fairytale_sentences	Then Goody peeped in at the hole, and called down--"Timmy Tiptoes!
anger	fairytale_sentences	Oh fie, Timmy Tiptoes!"
noemo	fairytale_sentences	And Timmy replied, "Is that you, Goody Tiptoes?
noemo	fairytale_sentences	Why, certainly!"
joy	fairytale_sentences	He came up and kissed Goody through the hole; but he was so fat that he could not get out.
joy	fairytale_sentences	Chippy Hackee was not too fat, but he did not want to come; he stayed down below and chuckled.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	And so it went on for a fort- night; till a big wind blew off the top of the tree, and opened up the hole and let in the rain.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	Then Timmy Tiptoes came out, and went home with an umbrella.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	But Chippy Hackee continued to camp out for another week, although it was uncomfortable.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	At last a large bear came walking through the wood.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	Perhaps he also was looking for nuts; he seemed to be sniffing around.
fear	fairytale_sentences	Chippy Hackee went home in a hurry!
sadness	fairytale_sentences	And when Chippy Hackee got home, he found he had caught a cold in his head; and he was more uncomfortable still.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	And now Timmy and Goody Tiptoes keep their nut store fastened up with a little padlock.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	And whenever that little bird sees the Chipmunks, he sings--"Who's-been-digging- up MY-nuts?
noemo	fairytale_sentences	Who's been dig- ging-up MY-nuts?"
noemo	fairytale_sentences	But nobody ever answers!
noemo	fairytale_sentences	Once upon a time there were four little Rabbits, and their names were-- Flopsy, Mopsy, Cotton-tail, and Peter.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	They lived with their Mother in a sand-bank, underneath the root of a very big fir-tree.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	"Now, my dears," said old Mrs. Rabbit one morning, "you may go into the fields or down the lane, but don't go into Mr. McGregor's garden: your Father had an accident there; he was put in a pie by Mrs. McGregor."
noemo	fairytale_sentences	"Now run along, and don't get into mischief.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	I am going out."
noemo	fairytale_sentences	Then old Mrs. Rabbit took a basket and her umbrella, and went through the wood to the baker's.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	She bought a loaf of brown bread and five currant buns.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	Flopsy, Mopsy, and Cotton-tail, who were good little bunnies, went down the lane to gather blackberries;
noemo	fairytale_sentences	But Peter, who was very naughty, ran straight away to Mr. McGregor's garden, and squeezed under the gate!
noemo	fairytale_sentences	First he ate some lettuces and some French beans; and then he ate some radishes;
sadness	fairytale_sentences	And then, feeling rather sick, he went to look for some parsley.
surprise	fairytale_sentences	But round the end of a cucumber frame, whom should he meet but Mr. McGregor!
anger	fairytale_sentences	Mr. McGregor was on his hands and knees planting out young cabbages, but he jumped up and ran after Peter, waving a rake and calling out, "Stop thief."
fear	fairytale_sentences	Peter was most dreadfully frightened; he rushed all over the garden, for he had forgotten the way back to the gate.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	He lost one of his shoes among the cabbages, and the other shoe amongst the potatoes.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	After losing them, he ran on four legs and went faster, so that I think he might have got away altogether if he had not unfortunately run into a gooseberry net, and got caught by the large buttons on his jacket.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	It was a blue jacket with brass buttons, quite new.
sadness	fairytale_sentences	Peter gave himself up for lost, and shed big tears; but his sobs were overheard by some friendly sparrows, who flew to him in great excitement, and implored him to exert himself.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	Mr. McGregor came up with a sieve, which he intended to pop upon the top of Peter; but Peter wriggled out just in time, leaving his jacket behind him.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	And rushed into the toolshed, and jumped into a can.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	It would have been a beautiful thing to hide in, if it had not had so much water in it.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	Mr. McGregor was quite sure that Peter was somewhere in the toolshed, perhaps hidden underneath a flower- pot.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	He began to turn them over carefully, looking under each.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	Presently Peter sneezed-- "Kertyschoo!"
noemo	fairytale_sentences	Mr. McGregor was after him in no time,
noemo	fairytale_sentences	And tried to put his foot upon Peter, who jumped out of a window, upsetting three plants.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	The window was too small for Mr. McGregor, and he was tired of running after Peter.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	He went back to his work.
fear	fairytale_sentences	Peter sat down to rest; he was out of breath and trembling with fright, and he had not the least idea which way to go.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	Also he was very damp with sitting in that can.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	After a time he began to wander about, going lippity--lippity--not very fast, and looking all around.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	He found a door in a wall; but it was locked, and there was no room for a fat little rabbit to squeeze underneath.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	An old mouse was running in and out over the stone doorstep, carrying peas and beans to her family in the wood.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	Peter asked her the way to the gate, but she had such a large pea in her mouth that she could not answer.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	She only shook her head at him.
sadness	fairytale_sentences	Peter began to cry.
sadness	fairytale_sentences	Then he tried to find his way straight across the garden, but he became more and more puzzled.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	Presently, he came to a pond where Mr. McGregor filled his water-cans.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	A white cat was staring at some goldfish; she sat very, very still, but now and then the tip of her tail twitched as if it were alive.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	Peter thought it best to go away without speaking to her; he has heard about cats from his cousin, little Benjamin Bunny.
surprise	fairytale_sentences	He went back towards the toolshed, but suddenly, quite close to him, he heard the noise of a hoe-- scr-r-ritch, scratch, scratch, scritch.
fear	fairytale_sentences	Peter scuttered underneath the bushes.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	But presently, as nothing happened, he came out, and climbed upon a wheelbarrow, and peeped over.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	The first thing he saw was Mr. McGregor hoeing onions.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	His back was turned towards Peter, and beyond him was the gate!
noemo	fairytale_sentences	Peter got down very quietly off the wheelbarrow, and started running as fast as he could go, along a straight walk behind some black-currant bushes.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	Mr. McGregor caught sight of him at the corner, but Peter did not care.
surprise	fairytale_sentences	He slipped underneath the gate, and was safe at last in the wood outside the garden.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	Mr. McGregor hung up the little jacket and the shoes for a scare-crow to frighten the blackbirds.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	Peter never stopped running or looked behind him till he got home to the big fir-tree.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	He was so tired that he flopped down upon the nice soft sand on the floor of the rabbit-hole, and shut his eyes.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	His mother was busy cooking; she wondered what he had done with his clothes.
surprise	fairytale_sentences	It was the second little jacket and pair of shoes that Peter had lost in a fortnight!
sadness	fairytale_sentences	I am sorry to say that Peter was not very well during the evening.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	His mother put him to bed, and made some camomile tea; and she gave a dose of it to Peter!
noemo	fairytale_sentences	"One table-spoonful to be taken at bed-time."
noemo	fairytale_sentences	But Flopsy, Mopsy, and Cotton-tail had bread and milk and blackberries for supper.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	Pussy-cat sits by the fire--how should she be fair?
noemo	fairytale_sentences	In walks the little dog--says "Pussy are you there?
noemo	fairytale_sentences	How do you do Mistress Pussy?
noemo	fairytale_sentences	Mistress Pussy, how do you do?"
joy	fairytale_sentences	"I thank you kindly, little dog, I fare as well as you!" [Old Rhyme]
noemo	fairytale_sentences	Once upon a time there was a Pussy-cat called Ribby, who invited a little dog called Duchess to tea.
joy	fairytale_sentences	"Come in good time, my dear Duchess," said Ribby's letter, "and we will have something so very nice.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	I am baking it in a pie-dish--a pie-dish with a pink rim.
joy	fairytale_sentences	You never tasted anything so good!
joy	fairytale_sentences	And YOU shall eat it all! _I_ will eat muffins, my dear Duchess!" wrote Ribby.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	"I will come very punctually, my dear Ribby," wrote Duchess; and then at the end she added--"I hope it isn't mouse?"
noemo	fairytale_sentences	And then she thought that did not look quite polite; so she scratched out "isn't mouse" and changed it to "I hope it will be fine," and she gave her letter to the postman.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	But she thought a great deal about Ribby's pie, and she read Ribby's letter over and over again.
fear	fairytale_sentences	"I am dreadfully afraid it WILL be mouse!" said Duchess to herself--"I really couldn't, COULDN'T eat mouse pie.
fear	fairytale_sentences	And I shall have to eat it, because it is a party.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	And MY pie was going to be veal and ham.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	A pink and white pie-dish! and so is mine; just like Ribby's dishes; they were both bought at Tabitha Twitchit's."
noemo	fairytale_sentences	Duchess went into her larder and took the pie off a shelf and looked at it.
joy	fairytale_sentences	"Oh what a good idea!
joy	fairytale_sentences	Why shouldn't I rush along and put my pie into Ribby's oven when Ribby isn't there?"
noemo	fairytale_sentences	Ribby in the meantime had received Duchess's answer, and as soon as she was sure that the little dog would come--she popped HER pie into the oven.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	There were two ovens, one above the other; some other knobs and handles were only ornamental and not intended to open.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	Ribby put the pie into the lower oven; the door was very stiff.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	"The top oven bakes too quickly," said Ribby to herself.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	Ribby put on some coal and swept up the hearth.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	Then she went out with a can to the well, for water to fill up the kettle.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	Then she began to set the room in order, for it was the sitting-room as well as the kitchen.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	When Ribby had laid the table she went out down the field to the farm, to fetch milk and butter.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	When she came back, she peeped into the bottom oven; the pie looked very comfortable.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	Ribby put on her shawl and bonnet and went out again with a basket, to the village shop to buy a packet of tea, a pound of lump sugar, and a pot of marmalade.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	And just at the same time, Duchess came out of HER house, at the other end of the village.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	Ribby met Duchess half-way down the street, also carrying a basket, covered with a cloth.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	They only bowed to one another; they did not speak, because they were going to have a party.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	As soon as Duchess had got round the corner out of sight--she simply ran!
noemo	fairytale_sentences	Straight away to Ribby's house!
joy	fairytale_sentences	Ribby went into the shop and bought what she required, and came out, after a pleasant gossip with Cousin Tabitha Twitchit.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	Ribby went on to Timothy Baker's and bought the muffins.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	Then she went home.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	There seemed to be a sort of scuffling noise in the back passage, as she was coming in at the front door.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	But there was nobody there.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	Duchess in the meantime, had slipped out at the back door.
surprise	fairytale_sentences	"It is a very odd thing that Ribby's pie was NOT in the oven when I put mine in!
surprise	fairytale_sentences	And I can't find it anywhere; I have looked all over the house.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	I put MY pie into a nice hot oven at the top.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	I could not turn any of the other handles; I think that they are all shams," said Duchess, "but I wish I could have removed the pie made of mouse!
noemo	fairytale_sentences	I cannot think what she has done with it?
surprise	fairytale_sentences	I heard Ribby coming and I had to run out by the back door!"
noemo	fairytale_sentences	Duchess went home and brushed her beautiful black coat; and then she picked a bunch of flowers in her garden as a present for Ribby; and passed the time until the clock struck four.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	Ribby--having assured herself by careful search that there was really no one hiding in the cupboard or in the larder--went upstairs to change her dress.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	She came downstairs again, and made the tea, and put the teapot on the hob.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	She peeped again into the BOTTOM oven, the pie had become a lovely brown, and it was steaming hot.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	She sat down before the fire to wait for the little dog.
joy	fairytale_sentences	"I am glad I used the BOTTOM oven," said Ribby, "the top one would certainly have been very much too hot."
noemo	fairytale_sentences	Very punctually at four o'clock, Duchess started to go to the party.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	At a quarter past four to the minute, there came a most genteel little tap-tappity.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	"Is Mrs. Ribston at home?" inquired Duchess in the porch.
joy	fairytale_sentences	"Come in! and how do you do, my dear Duchess?" cried Ribby.
joy	fairytale_sentences	"I hope I see you well?"
joy	fairytale_sentences	"Quite well, I thank you, and how do YOU do, my dear Ribby?" said Duchess.
joy	fairytale_sentences	"I've brought you some flowers; what a delicious smell of pie!"
joy	fairytale_sentences	"Oh, what lovely flowers!
joy	fairytale_sentences	Yes, it is mouse and bacon!"
noemo	fairytale_sentences	"I think it wants another five minutes," said Ribby.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	"Just a shade longer; I will pour out the tea, while we wait.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	Do you take sugar, my dear Duchess?"
joy	fairytale_sentences	"Oh yes, please! my dear Ribby; and may I have a lump upon my nose?"
joy	fairytale_sentences	"With pleasure, my dear Duchess."
noemo	fairytale_sentences	Duchess sat up with the sugar on her nose and sniffed--
joy	fairytale_sentences	"How good that pie smells!
joy	fairytale_sentences	I do love veal and ham--I mean to say mouse and bacon--"
noemo	fairytale_sentences	She dropped the sugar in confusion, and had to go hunting under the tea- table, so did not see which oven Ribby opened in order to get out the pie.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	Ribby set the pie upon the table; there was a very savoury smell.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	Duchess came out from under the table-cloth munching sugar, and sat up on a chair.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	"I will first cut the pie for you; I am going to have muffin and marmalade," said Ribby.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	"I think"--(thought Duchess to herself)--"I THINK it would be wiser if I helped myself to pie; though Ribby did not seem to notice anything when she was cutting it.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	What very small fine pieces it has cooked into!
noemo	fairytale_sentences	I did not remember that I had minced it up so fine; I suppose this is a quicker oven than my own."
noemo	fairytale_sentences	The pie-dish was emptying rapidly!
noemo	fairytale_sentences	Duchess had had four helps already, and was fumbling with the spoon.
joy	fairytale_sentences	"A little more bacon, my dear Duchess?" said Ribby.
joy	fairytale_sentences	"Thank you, my dear Ribby; I was only feeling for the patty-pan."
noemo	fairytale_sentences	"The patty-pan? my dear Duchess?"
noemo	fairytale_sentences	"The patty pan that held up the pie-crust," said Duchess, blushing under her black coat.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	"Oh, I didn't put one in, my dear Duchess," said Ribby; "I don't think that it is necessary in pies made of mouse."
surprise	fairytale_sentences	"There isn't a patty-pan," said Ribby, looking perplexed.
surprise	fairytale_sentences	"Yes, indeed, my dear Ribby; where can it have gone to?" said Duchess.
fear	fairytale_sentences	Duchess looked very much alarmed, and continued to scoop the inside of the pie-dish.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	"I have only four patty-pans, and they are all in the cupboard."
fear	fairytale_sentences	Oh, my dear Ribby, I do feel so ill!"
noemo	fairytale_sentences	"It is impossible, my dear Duchess; there was not a patty-pan."
fear	fairytale_sentences	"Yes there WAS, my dear Ribby, I am sure I have swallowed it!"
noemo	fairytale_sentences	"Let me prop you up with a pillow, my dear Duchess; where do you think you feel it?"
fear	fairytale_sentences	"Oh I do feel so ill ALL OVER me, my dear Ribby."
noemo	fairytale_sentences	"Shall I run for the doctor?"
noemo	fairytale_sentences	"Oh yes, yes! fetch Dr. Maggotty, my dear Ribby: he is a Pie himself, he will certainly understand."
noemo	fairytale_sentences	Ribby settled Duchess in an armchair before the fire, and went out and hurried to the village to look for the doctor.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	She found him at the smithy.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	Ribby explained that her guest had swallowed a patty-pan.
fear	fairytale_sentences	Dr. Maggotty hopped so fast that Ribby had to run.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	It was most conspicuous.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	All the village could see that Ribby was fetching the doctor.
fear	fairytale_sentences	But while Ribby had been hunting for the doctor--a curious thing had happened to Duchess, who had been left by herself, sitting before the fire, sighing and groaning and feeling very unhappy.
surprise	fairytale_sentences	"How COULD I have swallowed it! such a large thing as a patty-pan!"
sadness	fairytale_sentences	She sat down again, and stared mournfully at the grate.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	The fire crackled and danced, and something sizz-z-zled!
surprise	fairytale_sentences	Duchess started!
surprise	fairytale_sentences	She opened the door of the TOP oven;--out came a rich steamy flavour of veal and ham, and there stood a fine brown pie,-- and through a hole in the top of the pie-crust there was a glimpse of a little tin patty-pan!
joy	fairytale_sentences	Duchess drew a long breath--
surprise	fairytale_sentences	"Then I must have been eating MOUSE!
noemo	fairytale_sentences	. . .
noemo	fairytale_sentences	. . .
noemo	fairytale_sentences	But perhaps I should feel worse if I had really swallowed a patty-pan!"
fear	fairytale_sentences	Duchess reflected--"What a very awkward thing to have to explain to Ribby!
noemo	fairytale_sentences	I think I will put MY pie in the back-yard and say nothing about it.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	When I go home, I will run round and take it away."
noemo	fairytale_sentences	She put it outside the back-door, and sat down again by the fire, and shut her eyes; when Ribby arrived with the doctor, she seemed fast asleep.
joy	fairytale_sentences	"I am feeling very much better," said Duchess, waking up with a jump.
joy	fairytale_sentences	"I am truly glad to hear it!
noemo	fairytale_sentences	He has brought you a pill, my dear Duchess!"
noemo	fairytale_sentences	"I think I should feel QUITE well if he only felt my pulse," said Duchess, backing away from the magpie, who sidled up with something in his beak.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	"It is only a bread pill, you had much better take it; drink a little milk, my dear Duchess!"
noemo	fairytale_sentences	"I am feeling very much better, my dear Ribby," said Duchess.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	"Do you not think that I had better go home before it gets dark?"
noemo	fairytale_sentences	"Perhaps it might be wise, my dear Duchess."
joy	fairytale_sentences	Ribby and Duchess said good-bye affectionately, and Duchess started home.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	Half-way up the lane she stopped and looked back; Ribby had gone in and shut her door.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	Duchess slipped through the fence, and ran round to the back of Ribby's house, and peeped into the yard.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	Upon the roof of the pig-stye sat Dr. Maggotty and three jackdaws.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	The jackdaws were eating piecrust, and the magpie was drinking gravy out of a patty-pan.
surprise	fairytale_sentences	When Ribby came out for a pailful of water to wash up the tea-things, she found a pink and white pie-dish lying smashed in the middle of the yard.
surprise	fairytale_sentences	Ribby stared with amazement-- "Did you ever see the like! so there really WAS a patty-pan?
noemo	fairytale_sentences	. . .
surprise	fairytale_sentences	But MY patty-pans are all in the kitchen cupboard.
surprise	fairytale_sentences	Well I never did!
noemo	fairytale_sentences	. . .
noemo	fairytale_sentences	Next time I want to give a party--I will invite Cousin Tabitha Twitchit!"
noemo	fairytale_sentences	Once upon a time there was a frog called Mr. Jeremy Fisher; he lived in a little damp house amongst the buttercups at the edge of a pond.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	The water was all slippy-sloppy in the larder and in the back passage.
joy	fairytale_sentences	But Mr. Jeremy liked getting his feet wet; nobody ever scolded him, and he never caught a cold!
joy	fairytale_sentences	He was quite pleased when he looked out and saw large drops of rain, splashing in the pond--
noemo	fairytale_sentences	"I will get some worms and go fishing and catch a dish of minnows for my dinner," said Mr. Jeremy Fisher.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	"If I catch more than five fish, I will invite my friends Mr. Alderman Ptolemy Tortoise and Sir Isaac Newton.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	The Alderman, however, eats salad."
noemo	fairytale_sentences	Mr. Jeremy put on a mackintosh, and a pair of shiny galoshes; he took his rod and basket, and set off with enormous hops to the place where he kept his boat.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	The boat was round and green, and very like the other lily-leaves.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	It was tied to a water-plant in the middle of the pond.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	Mr. Jeremy took a reed pole, and pushed the boat out into open water.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	"I know a good place for minnows," said Mr. Jeremy Fisher.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	Mr. Jeremy stuck his pole into the mud and fastened the boat to it.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	Then he settled himself cross- legged and arranged his fishing tackle.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	He had the dearest little red float.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	His rod was a tough stalk of grass, his line was a fine long white horse-hair, and he tied a little wriggling worm at the end.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	The rain trickled down his back, and for nearly an hour he stared at the float.
disgust	fairytale_sentences	"This is getting tiresome, I think I should like some lunch," said Mr. Jeremy Fisher.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	He punted back again amongst the water-plants, and took some lunch out of his basket.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	"I will eat a butterfly sandwich, and wait till the shower is over," said Mr. Jeremy Fisher.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	A great big water-beetle came up underneath the lily leaf and tweaked the toe of one of his galoshes.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	Mr. Jeremy crossed his legs up shorter, out of reach, and went on eating his sandwich.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	Once or twice something moved about with a rustle and a splash amongst the rushes at the side of the pond.
fear	fairytale_sentences	"I trust that is not a rat," said Mr. Jeremy Fisher; "I think I had better get away from here."
noemo	fairytale_sentences	Mr. Jeremy shoved the boat out again a little way, and dropped in the bait.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	There was a bite almost directly; the float gave a tremendous bobbit!
surprise	fairytale_sentences	"A minnow! a minnow!
surprise	fairytale_sentences	I have him by the nose!" cried Mr. Jeremy Fisher, jerking up his rod.
surprise	fairytale_sentences	But what a horrible surprise!
noemo	fairytale_sentences	Instead of a smooth fat minnow, Mr. Jeremy landed little Jack Sharp, the stickleback, covered with spines!
noemo	fairytale_sentences	Then he jumped back into the water.
surprise	fairytale_sentences	A great big enormous trout came up--ker-pflop-p-p-p! with a splash-- and it seized Mr. Jeremy with a snap, "Ow!
surprise	fairytale_sentences	Ow!
surprise	fairytale_sentences	Ow!"--and then it turned and dived down to the bottom of the pond!
disgust	fairytale_sentences	But the trout was so displeased with the taste of the mackintosh, that in less than half a minute it spat him out again; and the only thing it swallowed was Mr. Jeremy's galoshes.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	Mr. Jeremy bounced up to the surface of the water, like a cork and the bubbles out of a soda water bottle; and he swam with all his might to the edge of the pond.
fear	fairytale_sentences	He scrambled out on the first bank he came to, and he hopped home across the meadow with his mackintosh all in tatters.
joy	fairytale_sentences	"What a mercy that was not a pike!" said Mr. Jeremy Fisher.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	He put some sticking plaster on his fingers, and his friends both came to dinner.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	He could not offer them fish, but he had something else in his larder.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	Sir Isaac Newton wore his black and gold waistcoat.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	And Mr. Alderman Ptolemy Tortoise brought a salad with him in a string bag.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	And instead of a nice dish of minnows, they had a roasted grasshopper with lady-bird sauce, which frogs consider a beautiful treat; but _I_ think it must have been nasty!
noemo	fairytale_sentences	Once upon a time there was an old pig called Aunt Pettitoes.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	She had eight of a family: four little girl pigs, called Cross-patch, Suck-suck, Yock-yock and Spot; and four little boy pigs, called Alexander, Pigling Bland, Chin-Chin and Stumpy.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	Stumpy had had an accident to his tail.
joy	fairytale_sentences	The eight little pigs had very fine appetites--"Yus, yus, yus! they eat and indeed they DO eat!" said Aunt Pettitoes, looking at her family with pride.
fear	fairytale_sentences	Suddenly there were fearful squeals; Alexander had squeezed inside the hoops of the pig trough and stuck.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	Aunt Pettitoes and I dragged him out by the hind legs.
fear	fairytale_sentences	Chin-chin was already in disgrace; it was washing day, and he had eaten a piece of soap.
surprise	fairytale_sentences	And presently in a basket of clean clothes, we found another dirty little pig--"Tchut, tut, tut! whichever is this?" grunted Aunt Pettitoes.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	Now all the pig family are pink, or pink with black spots, but this pig child was smutty black all over; when it had been popped into a tub, it proved to be Yock-yock.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	I went into the garden; there I found Cross-patch and Suck-suck rooting up carrots.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	I whipped them myself and led them out by the ears.
anger	fairytale_sentences	Cross-patch tried to bite me.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	"Aunt Pettitoes, Aunt Pettitoes! you are a worthy person, but your family is not well brought up.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	Every one of them has been in mischief except Spot and Pigling Bland."
noemo	fairytale_sentences	"And they drink bucketfuls of milk; I shall have to get another cow!
noemo	fairytale_sentences	Good little Spot shall stay at home to do the housework; but the others must go.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	Four little boy pigs and four little girl pigs are too many altogether."
sadness	fairytale_sentences	"Yus, yus, yus," said Aunt Pettitoes, "there will be more to eat without them."
noemo	fairytale_sentences	So Chin-chin and Suck-suck went away in a wheel-barrow, and Stumpy, Yock-yock and Cross- patch rode away in a cart.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	And the other two little boy pigs, Pigling Bland and Alexander went to market.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	We brushed their coats, we curled their tails and washed their little faces, and wished them good bye in the yard.
sadness	fairytale_sentences	Aunt Pettitoes wiped her eyes with a large pocket handkerchief, then she wiped Pigling Bland's nose and shed tears; then she wiped Alexander's nose and shed tears; then she passed the handkerchief to Spot.
sadness	fairytale_sentences	Aunt Pettitoes sighed and grunted, and addressed those little pigs as follows--
noemo	fairytale_sentences	"Now Pigling Bland, son Pigling Bland, you must go to market.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	Take your brother Alexander by the hand.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	Mind your Sunday clothes, and remember to blow your nose" --(Aunt Pettitoes passed round the handkerchief again)--"beware of traps, hen roosts, bacon and eggs; always walk upon your hind legs."
sadness	fairytale_sentences	Pigling Bland who was a sedate little pig, looked solemnly at his mother, a tear trickled down his cheek.
joy	fairytale_sentences	Aunt Pettitoes turned to the other--"Now son Alexander take the hand"--"Wee, wee, wee!" giggled Alexander--"take the hand of your brother Pigling Bland, you must go to market.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	Mind--" "Wee, wee, wee!" interrupted Alexander again.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	"You put me out," said Aunt Pettitoes--"Observe signposts and milestones; do not gobble herring bones--" "And remember," said I impressively, "if you once cross the county boundary you cannot come back.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	Alexander, you are not attending.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	Here are two licenses permitting two pigs to go to market in Lancashire.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	Attend Alexander.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	I have had no end of trouble in getting these papers from the policeman."
sadness	fairytale_sentences	Pigling Bland listened gravely; Alexander was hopelessly volatile.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	I pinned the papers, for safety, inside their waistcoat pockets; Aunt Pettitoes gave to each a little bundle, and eight conversation peppermints with appropriate moral sentiments in screws of paper.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	Then they started.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	Pigling Bland and Alexander trotted along steadily for a mile; at least Pigling Bland did.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	Alexander made the road half as long again by skipping from side to side.
joy	fairytale_sentences	He danced about and pinched his brother, singing--
joy	fairytale_sentences	"This pig went to market, this pig stayed at home, "This pig had a bit of meat--
noemo	fairytale_sentences	let's see what they have given US for dinner, Pigling?"
noemo	fairytale_sentences	Pigling Bland and Alexander sat down and untied their bundles.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	Alexander gobbled up his dinner in no time; he had already eaten all his own peppermints--"Give me one of yours, please, Pigling?"
noemo	fairytale_sentences	"But I wish to preserve them for emergencies," said Pigling Bland doubtfully.
joy	fairytale_sentences	Alexander went into squeals of laughter.
anger	fairytale_sentences	Then he pricked Pigling with the pin that had fastened his pig paper; and when Pigling slapped him he dropped the pin, and tried to take Pigling's pin, and the papers got mixed up.
anger	fairytale_sentences	Pigling Bland reproved Alexander.
joy	fairytale_sentences	But presently they made it up again, and trotted away together, singing--
noemo	fairytale_sentences	"Tom, Tom the piper's son, stole a pig and away he ran!
noemo	fairytale_sentences	"But all the tune that he could play, was `Over the hills and far away!'"
noemo	fairytale_sentences	"What's that, young Sirs?
noemo	fairytale_sentences	Stole a pig?
noemo	fairytale_sentences	Where are your licenses?" said the policeman.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	They had nearly run against him round a corner.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	Pigling Bland pulled out his paper; Alexander, after fumbling, handed over something scrumply--
surprise	fairytale_sentences	"To 2 1/2 oz. conversation sweeties at three farthings"--"What's this? this ain't a license?"
fear	fairytale_sentences	Alexander's nose lengthened visibly, he had lost it.
fear	fairytale_sentences	"I had one, indeed I had, Mr. Policeman!"
noemo	fairytale_sentences	"It's not likely they let you start without.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	I am passing the farm.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	You may walk with me."
noemo	fairytale_sentences	"Can I come back too?" inquired Pigling Bland.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	"I see no reason, young Sir; your paper is all right."
fear	fairytale_sentences	Pigling Bland did not like going on alone, and it was beginning to rain.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	But it is unwise to argue with the police; he gave his brother a peppermint, and watched him out of sight.
sadness	fairytale_sentences	To conclude the adventures of Alexander--the policeman sauntered up to the house about tea time, followed by a damp subdued little pig.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	I disposed of Alexander in the neighborhood; he did fairly well when he had settled down.
sadness	fairytale_sentences	Pigling Bland went on alone dejectedly; he came to cross roads and a sign-post--"To Market-town 5 miles," "Over the Hills, 4 miles," "To Pettitoes Farm, 3 miles."
surprise	fairytale_sentences	Pigling Bland was shocked, there was little hope of sleeping in Market Town, and tomorrow was the hiring fair; it was deplorable to think how much time had been wasted by the frivolity of Alexander.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	He glanced wistfully along the road towards the hills, and then set off walking obediently the other way, buttoning up his coat against the rain.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	"I wish I could have a little garden and grow potatoes," said Pigling Bland.
surprise	fairytale_sentences	He put his cold hand in his pocket and felt his paper, he put his other hand in his other pocket and felt another paper--Alexander's!
noemo	fairytale_sentences	He took a wrong turn--several wrong turns, and was quite lost.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	It grew dark, the wind whistled, the trees creaked and groaned.
fear	fairytale_sentences	Pigling Bland became frightened and cried "Wee, wee, wee!
fear	fairytale_sentences	I can't find my way home!"
noemo	fairytale_sentences	After an hour's wandering he got out of the wood; the moon shone through the clouds, and Pigling Bland saw a country that was new to him.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	The road crossed a moor; below was a wide valley with a river twinkling in the moonlight, and beyond --in misty distance--lay the hills.
sadness	fairytale_sentences	He saw a small wooden hut, made his way to it, and crept inside --"I am afraid it IS a hen house, but what can I do?" said Pigling Bland, wet and cold and quite tired out.
joy	fairytale_sentences	"Bacon and eggs, bacon and eggs!" clucked a hen on a perch.
anger	fairytale_sentences	"Trap, trap, trap! cackle, cackle, cackle!" scolded the disturbed cockerel.
joy	fairytale_sentences	"To market, to market! jiggettyjig!" clucked a broody white hen roosting next to him.
fear	fairytale_sentences	Pigling Bland, much alarmed, determined to leave at daybreak.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	In the meantime, he and the hens fell asleep.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	In less than an hour they were all awakened.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	The owner, Mr. Peter Thomas Piperson, came with a lantern and a hamper to catch six fowls to take to market in the morning.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	He grabbed the white hen roosting next to the cock; then his eye fell upon Pigling Bland, squeezed up in a corner.
surprise	fairytale_sentences	He made a singular remark--"Hallo, here's another!" --seized Pigling by the scruff of the neck, and dropped him into the hamper.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	Then he dropped in five more dirty, kicking, cackling hens upon the top of Pigling Bland.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	The hamper containing six fowls and a young pig was no light weight; it was taken down hill, unsteadily, with jerks.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	Pigling, although nearly scratched to pieces, contrived to hide the papers and peppermints inside his clothes.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	At last the hamper was bumped down upon a kitchen floor, the lid was opened, and Pigling was lifted out.
joy	fairytale_sentences	He looked up, blinking, and saw an offensively ugly elderly man, grinning from ear to ear.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	"This one's come of himself, whatever," said Mr. Piperson, turning Pigling's pockets inside out.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	He pushed the hamper into a corner, threw a sack over it to keep the hens quiet, put a pot on the fire, and unlaced his boots.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	Pigling Bland drew forward a coppy stool, and sat on the edge of it, shyly warming his hands.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	Mr. Piperson pulled off a boot and threw it against the wainscot at the further end of the kitchen.
anger	fairytale_sentences	There was a smothered noise--"Shut up!" said Mr. Piperson.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	Pigling Bland warmed his hands, and eyed him.
anger	fairytale_sentences	Mr. Piperson pulled off the other boot and flung it after the first, there was again a curious noise-- "Be quiet, will ye?" said Mr. Piperson.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	Pigling Bland sat on the very edge of the coppy stool.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	Mr. Piperson fetched meal from a chest and made porridge, it seemed to Pigling that something at the further end of the kitchen was taking a suppressed interest in the cooking; but he was too hungry to be troubled by noises.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	Mr. Piperson poured out three platefuls: for himself, for Pigling, and a third-after glaring at Pigling-- he put away with much scuffling, and locked up.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	Pigling Bland ate his supper discreetly.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	After supper Mr. Piperson consulted an almanac, and felt Pigling's ribs; it was too late in the season for curing bacon, and he grudged his meal.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	Besides, the hens had seen this pig.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	He looked at the small remains of a flitch [side of bacon], and then looked undecidedly at Pigling.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	"You may sleep on the rug," said Mr. Peter Thomas Piperson.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	Pigling Bland slept like a top.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	In the morning Mr. Piperson made more porridge; the weather was warmer.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	He looked how much meal was left in the chest, and seemed dissatisfied--"You'll likely be moving on again?" said he to Pigling Bland.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	Before Pigling could reply, a neighbor, who was giving Mr. Piperson and the hens a lift, whistled from the gate.
anger	fairytale_sentences	Mr. Piperson hurried out with the hamper, enjoining Pigling to shut the door behind him and not meddle with nought; or "I'll come back and skin ye!" said Mr. Piperson.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	It crossed Pigling's mind that if HE had asked for a lift, too, he might still have been in time for market.
fear	fairytale_sentences	But he distrusted Peter Thomas.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	After finishing breakfast at his leisure, Pigling had a look round the cottage; everything was locked up.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	He found some potato peelings in a bucket in the back kitchen.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	Pigling ate the peel, and washed up the porridge plates in the bucket.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	He sang while he worked--
noemo	fairytale_sentences	"Tom with his pipe made such a noise, He called up all the girls and boys-- "And they all ran to hear him play, "Over the hills and far away!--"
noemo	fairytale_sentences	Suddenly a little smothered voice chimed in--
noemo	fairytale_sentences	"Over the hills and a great way off, The wind shall blow my top knot off."
surprise	fairytale_sentences	Pigling Bland put down a plate which he was wiping, and listened.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	After a long pause, Pigling went on tiptoe and peeped round the door into the front kitchen; there was nobody there.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	After another pause, Pigling approached the door of the locked cupboard, and snuffed at the keyhole.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	It was quite quiet.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	After another long pause, Pigling pushed a peppermint under the door.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	It was sucked in immediately.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	In the course of the day Pigling pushed in all his remaining six peppermints.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	When Mr. Piperson returned, he found Pigling sitting before the fire; he had brushed up the hearth and put on the pot to boil; the meal was not get-at-able.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	Mr. Piperson was very affable; he slapped Pigling on the back, made lots of porridge and forgot to lock the meal chest.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	He did lock the cupboard door; but without properly shutting it.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	He went to bed early, and told Pigling upon no account to disturb him next day before twelve o'clock.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	Pigling Bland sat by the fire, eating his supper.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	All at once at his elbow, a little voice spoke--"My name is Pig-wig.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	Make me more porridge, please!"
surprise	fairytale_sentences	Pigling Bland jumped, and looked round.
joy	fairytale_sentences	A perfectly lovely little black Berkshire pig stood smiling beside him.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	She had twinkly little screwed up eyes, a double chin, and a short turned up nose.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	She pointed at Pigling's plate; he hastily gave it to her, and fled to the meal chest--"How did you come here?" asked Pigling Bland.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	"Stolen," replied Pig-wig, with her mouth full.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	Pigling helped himself to meal without scruple.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	"What for?"
joy	fairytale_sentences	"Bacon, hams," replied Pig- wig cheerfully.
joy	fairytale_sentences	"I shall after supper," said Pig- wig decidedly.
joy	fairytale_sentences	Pigling Bland made more porridge and watched her shyly.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	She finished a second plate, got up, and looked about her, as though she were going to start.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	"You can't go in the dark," said Pigling Bland.
fear	fairytale_sentences	Pig-wig looked anxious.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	"Do you know your way by day- light?"
noemo	fairytale_sentences	"I know we can see this little white house from the hills across the river.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	Which way are _you_ going, Mr. Pig?"
noemo	fairytale_sentences	"To market--I have two pig papers.
sadness	fairytale_sentences	I might take you to the bridge; if you have no objection," said Pigling much confused and sitting on the edge of his coppy stool.
joy	fairytale_sentences	Pig- wig's gratitude was such and she asked so many questions that it became embarrassing to Pigling Bland.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	He was obliged to shut his eyes and pretend to sleep.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	She became quiet, and there was a smell of peppermint.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	"Only the corners," replied Pig- wig, studying the sentiments with much interest by the firelight.
fear	fairytale_sentences	"I wish you wouldn't; he might smell them through the ceiling," said the alarmed Pigling.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	Pig-wig put back the sticky peppermints into her pocket; "Sing something," she demanded.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	"I am sorry.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	. .
sadness	fairytale_sentences	I have tooth- ache," said Pigling much dismayed.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	"Then I will sing," replied Pig- wig, "You will not mind if I say iddy tidditty?
noemo	fairytale_sentences	I have forgotten some of the words."
noemo	fairytale_sentences	Pigling Bland made no objection; he sat with his eyes half shut, and watched her.
joy	fairytale_sentences	She wagged her head and rocked about, clapping time and singing in a sweet little grunty voice--
noemo	fairytale_sentences	"A funny old mother pig lived in a stye, and three little piggies had she; "(Ti idditty idditty) umph, umph, umph! and the little pigs said wee, wee!"
noemo	fairytale_sentences	She sang successfully through three or four verses, only at every verse her head nodded a little lower, and her little twinkly eyes closed up--
noemo	fairytale_sentences	"Those three little piggies grew peaky and lean, and lean they might very well be; "For somehow they couldn't say umph, umph, umph! and they wouldn't say wee, wee, wee!
noemo	fairytale_sentences	"For somehow they couldn't say--
noemo	fairytale_sentences	Pig-wig's head bobbed lower and lower, until she rolled over, a little round ball, fast asleep on the hearth-rug.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	Pigling Bland, on tiptoe, covered her up with an antimacassar.
fear	fairytale_sentences	He was afraid to go to sleep himself; for the rest of the night he sat listening to the chirping of the crickets and to the snores of Mr. Piperson overhead.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	Early in the morning, between dark and daylight, Pigling tied up his little bundle and woke up Pig- wig.
fear	fairytale_sentences	"But it's dark!
fear	fairytale_sentences	How can we find our way?"
noemo	fairytale_sentences	"The cock has crowed; we must start before the hens come out; they might shout to Mr. Piperson."
noemo	fairytale_sentences	"Come away Pig-wig; we can see when we get used to it.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	Come!
fear	fairytale_sentences	I can hear them clucking!"
noemo	fairytale_sentences	Pigling had never said shuh! to a hen in his life, being peaceable; also he remembered the hamper.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	He opened the house door quietly and shut it after them.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	There was no garden; the neighborhood of Mr. Piperson's was all scratched up by fowls.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	They slipped away hand in hand across an untidy field to the road.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	"Tom, Tom the piper's son, stole a pig and away he ran!
noemo	fairytale_sentences	"But all the tune that he could play, was `Over the hills and far away!'"
noemo	fairytale_sentences	"Come Pig-wig, we must get to the bridge before folks are stirring."
noemo	fairytale_sentences	"Why do you want to go to market, Pigling?" inquired Pig-wig.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	The sun rose while they were crossing the moor, a dazzle of light over the tops of the hills.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	The sunshine crept down the slopes into the peaceful green valleys, where little white cottages nestled in gardens and orchards.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	"That's Westmorland," said Pig- wig.
joy	fairytale_sentences	She dropped Pigling's hand and commenced to dance, singing-- presently.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	"I don't want; I want to grow potatoes."
noemo	fairytale_sentences	"Have a peppermint?" said Pig-wig.
anger	fairytale_sentences	Pigling Bland refused quite crossly.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	"Does your poor toothy hurt?" inquired Pig- wig.
anger	fairytale_sentences	Pigling Bland grunted.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	Pig-wig ate the peppermint herself, and followed the opposite side of the road.
anger	fairytale_sentences	"Pig-wig! keep under the wall, there's a man ploughing."
noemo	fairytale_sentences	Pig-wig crossed over, they hurried down hill towards the county boundary.
fear	fairytale_sentences	Suddenly Pigling stopped; he heard wheels.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	Slowly jogging up the road below them came a tradesman's cart.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	The reins flapped on the horse's back, the grocer was reading a newspaper.
fear	fairytale_sentences	"Take that peppermint out of your mouth, Pig-wig, we may have to run.
fear	fairytale_sentences	Don't say one word.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	Leave it to me.
fear	fairytale_sentences	And in sight of the bridge!" said poor Pigling, nearly crying.
fear	fairytale_sentences	He began to walk frightfully lame, holding Pig-wig's arm.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	The grocer, intent upon his newspaper, might have passed them, if his horse had not shied and snorted.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	He pulled the cart crossways, and held down his whip.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	"Hallo?
noemo	fairytale_sentences	Where are you going to?"--Pigling Bland stared at him vacantly.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	"Are you deaf?
noemo	fairytale_sentences	Are you going to market?"
noemo	fairytale_sentences	Pigling nodded slowly.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	"I thought as much.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	It was yesterday.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	Show me your license?"
noemo	fairytale_sentences	Pigling stared at the off hind shoe of the grocer's horse which had picked up a stone.
disgust	fairytale_sentences	The grocer flicked his whip-- "Papers?
disgust	fairytale_sentences	Pig license?"
noemo	fairytale_sentences	Pigling fumbled in all his pockets, and handed up the papers.
disgust	fairytale_sentences	The grocer read them, but still seemed dissatisfied.
surprise	fairytale_sentences	"This here pig is a young lady; is her name Alexander?"
noemo	fairytale_sentences	Pig-wig opened her mouth and shut it again; Pigling coughed asthmatically.
anger	fairytale_sentences	The grocer ran his finger down the advertisement column of his newspaper--"Lost, stolen or strayed, 10S. reward;" he looked suspiciously at Pig-wig.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	Then he stood up in the trap, and whistled for the ploughman.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	"You wait here while I drive on and speak to him," said the grocer, gathering up the reins.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	He knew that pigs are slippery; but surely, such a VERY lame pig could never run!
fear	fairytale_sentences	"Not yet, Pig-wig, he will look back."
noemo	fairytale_sentences	The grocer did so; he saw the two pigs stock-still in the middle of the road.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	Then he looked over at his horse's heels; it was lame also; the stone took some time to knock out, after he got to the ploughman.
fear	fairytale_sentences	"Now, Pig-wig, NOW!" said Pigling Bland.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	Never did any pigs run as these pigs ran!
noemo	fairytale_sentences	They raced and squealed and pelted down the long white hill towards the bridge.
fear	fairytale_sentences	Little fat Pig- wig's petticoats fluttered, and her feet went pitter, patter, pitter, as she bounded and jumped.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	They ran, and they ran, and they ran down the hill, and across a short cut on level green turf at the bottom, between pebble beds and rushes.
joy	fairytale_sentences	They came to the river, they came to the bridge--they crossed it hand in hand--then over the hills and far away she danced with Pigling Bland!
noemo	fairytale_sentences	This is a Pussy called Miss Moppet; she thinks she has heard a mouse!
noemo	fairytale_sentences	He is not afraid of a kitten.
surprise	fairytale_sentences	This is Miss Moppet jumping just too late; she misses the Mouse and hits her own head.
surprise	fairytale_sentences	She thinks it is a very hard cupboard!
noemo	fairytale_sentences	The Mouse watches Miss Moppet from the top of the cupboard.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	Miss Moppet ties up her head in a duster and sits before the fire.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	The Mouse thinks she is looking very ill.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	He comes sliding down the bellpull.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	Miss Moppet looks worse and worse.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	The Mouse comes a little nearer.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	Miss Moppet holds her poor head in her paws and looks at him through a hole in the duster.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	The Mouse comes VERY close.
surprise	fairytale_sentences	And then all of a sudden--Miss Moppet jumps upon the Mouse!
disgust	fairytale_sentences	And because the Mouse has teased Miss Moppet--Miss Moppet thinks she will tease the Mouse, which is not at all nice of Miss Moppet.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	She ties him up in the duster and tosses it about like a ball.
surprise	fairytale_sentences	But she forgot about that hole in the duster; and when she untied it-- there was no Mouse!
joy	fairytale_sentences	He has wriggled out and run away; and he is dancing a jig on top of the cupboard!
noemo	fairytale_sentences	"I'll be at charges for a looking-glass; And entertain a score or two of tailors." [Richard III]
noemo	fairytale_sentences	My Dear Freda:
noemo	fairytale_sentences	Because you are fond of fairytales, and have been ill, I have made you a story all for yourself--a new one that nobody has read before.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	And the queerest thing about it is--that I heard it in Gloucestershire, and that it is true--at least about the tailor, the waistcoat, and the "No more twist!" _Christmas_
noemo	fairytale_sentences	In the time of swords and peri wigs and full-skirted coats with flowered lappets--when gentlemen wore ruffles, and gold-laced waistcoats of paduasoy and taffeta--there lived a tailor in Gloucester.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	He sat in the window of a little shop in Westgate Street, cross-legged on a table from morning till dark.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	All day long while the light lasted he sewed and snippetted, piecing out his satin, and pompadour, and lutestring; stuffs had strange names, and were very expensive in the days of the Tailor of Gloucester.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	But although he sewed fine silk for his neighbours, he himself was very, very poor.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	He cut his coats without waste; according to his embroidered cloth, they were very small ends and snippets that lay about upon the table--"Too narrow breadths for nought--except waistcoats for mice," said the tailor.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	One bitter cold day near Christmastime the tailor began to make a coat (a coat of cherry- coloured corded silk embroidered with pansies and roses) and a cream- coloured satin waistcoat for the Mayor of Gloucester.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	The tailor worked and worked, and he talked to himself: "No breadth at all, and cut on the cross; it is no breadth at all; tippets for mice and ribbons for mobs! for mice!" said the Tailor of Gloucester.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	When the snow-flakes came down against the small leaded window- panes and shut out the light, the tailor had done his day's work; all the silk and satin lay cut out upon the table.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	There were twelve pieces for the coat and four pieces for the waistcoat; and there were pocket-flaps and cuffs and buttons, all in order.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	For the lining of the coat there was fine yellow taffeta, and for the button- holes of the waistcoat there was cherry-coloured twist.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	And everything was ready to sew together in the morning, all measured and sufficient--except that there was wanting just one single skein of cherry-coloured twisted silk.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	The tailor came out of his shop at dark.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	No one lived there at nights but little brown mice, and THEY ran in and out without any keys!
noemo	fairytale_sentences	For behind the wooden wainscots of all the old houses in Gloucester, there are little mouse staircases and secret trap-doors; and the mice run from house to house through those long, narrow passages.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	But the tailor came out of his shop and shuffled home through the snow.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	And although it was not a big house, the tailor was so poor he only rented the kitchen.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	He lived alone with his cat; it was called Simpkin.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	"Miaw?" said the cat when the tailor opened the door, "miaw?"
sadness	fairytale_sentences	The tailor replied: "Simpkin, we shall make our fortune, but I am worn to a ravelling.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	Take this groat (which is our last fourpence), and, Simpkin, take a china pipkin, but a penn'orth of bread, a penn'orth of milk, and a penn'orth of sausages.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	And oh, Simpkin, with the last penny of our fourpence but me one penn'orth of cherry-coloured silk.
sadness	fairytale_sentences	But do not lose the last penny of the fourpence, Simpkin, or I am undone and worn to a thread-paper, for I have NO MORE TWIST."
noemo	fairytale_sentences	Then Simpkin again said "Miaw!" and took the groat and the pipkin, and went out into the dark.
sadness	fairytale_sentences	The tailor was very tired and beginning to be ill.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	He sat down by the hearth and talked to himself about that wonderful coat.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	"I shall make my fortune--to be cut bias--the Mayor of Gloucester is to be married on Christmas Day in the morning, and he hath ordered a coat and an embroidered waistcoat--"
surprise	fairytale_sentences	Then the tailor started; for suddenly, interrupting him, from the dresser at the other side of the kitchen came a number of little noises--
noemo	fairytale_sentences	Tip tap, tip tap, tip tap tip!
surprise	fairytale_sentences	"Now what can that be?" said the Tailor of Gloucester, jumping up from his chair.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	The tailor crossed the kitchen, and stood quite still beside the dresser, listening, and peering through his spectacles.
surprise	fairytale_sentences	"This is very peculiar," said the Tailor of Gloucester, and he lifted up the tea-cup which was upside down.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	Out stepped a little live lady mouse, and made a courtesy to the tailor!
noemo	fairytale_sentences	Then she hopped away down off the dresser, and under the wainscot.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	The tailor sat down again by the fire, warming his poor cold hands.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	But all at once, from the dresser, there came other little noises--
noemo	fairytale_sentences	Tip tap, tip tap, tip tap tip!
noemo	fairytale_sentences	Out stepped a little gentleman mouse, and made a bow to the tailor!
noemo	fairytale_sentences	And out from under tea-cups and from under bowls and basins, stepped other and more little mice, who hopped away down off the dresser and under the wainscot.
sadness	fairytale_sentences	The tailor sat down, close over the fire, lamenting: "One-and-twenty buttonholes of cherry-coloured silk!
noemo	fairytale_sentences	To be finished by noon of Saturday: and this is Tuesday evening.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	Was it right to let loose those mice, undoubtedly the property of Simpkin?
noemo	fairytale_sentences	The little mice came out again and listened to the tailor; they took notice of the pattern of that wonderful coat.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	They whispered to one another about the taffeta lining and about little mouse tippets.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	And then suddenly they all ran away together down the passage behind the wainscot, squeaking and calling to one another as they ran from house to house.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	Not one mouse was left in the tailor's kitchen when Simpkin came back.
surprise	fairytale_sentences	He set down the pipkin of milk upon the dresser, and looked suspiciously at the tea-cups.
surprise	fairytale_sentences	He wanted his supper of little fat mouse!
anger	fairytale_sentences	"Simpkin," said the tailor, "where is my TWIST?"
anger	fairytale_sentences	But Simpkin hid a little parcel privately in the tea-pot, and spit and growled at the tailor; and if Simpkin had been able to talk, he would have asked: "Where is my MOUSE?"
sadness	fairytale_sentences	"Alack, I am undone!" said the Tailor of Gloucester, and went sadly to bed.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	All that night long Simpkin hunted and searched through the kitchen, peeping into cupboards and under the wainscot, and into the tea-pot where he had hidden that twist; but still he found never a mouse!
sadness	fairytale_sentences	The poor old tailor was very ill with a fever, tossing and turning in his four-post bed; and still in his dreams he mumbled: "No more twist! no more twist!"
noemo	fairytale_sentences	What should become of the cherry- coloured coat?
noemo	fairytale_sentences	Who should come to sew it, when the window was barred, and the door was fast locked?
noemo	fairytale_sentences	Out-of-doors the market folks went trudging through the snow to buy their geese and turkeys, and to bake their Christmas pies; but there would be no dinner for Simpkin and the poor old tailor of Gloucester.
sadness	fairytale_sentences	The tailor lay ill for three days and nights; and then it was Christmas Eve, and very late at night.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	But it is in the old story that all the beasts can talk in the night between Christmas Eve and Christmas Day in the morning (though there are very few folk that can hear them, or know what it is that they say).
noemo	fairytale_sentences	When the Cathedral clock struck twelve there was an answer--like an echo of the chimes--and Simpkin heard it, and came out of the tailor's door, and wandered about in the snow.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	From all the roofs and gables and old wooden houses in Gloucester came a thousand merry voices singing the old Christmas rhymes--all the old songs that ever I heard of, and some that I don't know, like Whittington's bells.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	Under the wooden eaves the starlings and sparrows sang of Christmas pies; the jackdaws woke up in the Cathedral tower; and although it was the middle of the night the throstles and robins sang; and air was quite full of little twittering tunes.
sadness	fairytale_sentences	But it was all rather provoking to poor hungry Simpkin.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	From the tailor's ship in Westgate came a glow of light; and when Simpkin crept up to peep in at the window it was full of candles.
joy	fairytale_sentences	There was a snippeting of scissors, and snappeting of thread; and little mouse voices sang loudly and gaily:
noemo	fairytale_sentences	"Four-and-twenty tailors Went to catch a snail, The best man amongst them Durst not touch her tail; She put out her horns Like a little kyloe cow.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	Run, tailors, run!
noemo	fairytale_sentences	Or she'll have you all e'en now!"
noemo	fairytale_sentences	Then without a pause the little mouse voices went on again:
noemo	fairytale_sentences	"Sieve my lady's oatmeal, Grind my lady's flour, Put it in a chestnut, Let it stand an hour--"
noemo	fairytale_sentences	"Mew!
noemo	fairytale_sentences	Mew!" interrupted Simpkin, and he scratched at the door.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	But the key was under the tailor's pillow; he could not get in.
joy	fairytale_sentences	The little mice only laughed, and tried another tune--
noemo	fairytale_sentences	"Three little mice sat down to spin, Pussy passed by and she peeped in.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	What are you at, my fine little men?
noemo	fairytale_sentences	Making coats for gentlemen.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	Shall I come in and cut off yours threads?
noemo	fairytale_sentences	Oh, no, Miss Pussy, You'd bite off our heads!"
anger	fairytale_sentences	"Mew! scratch! scratch!" scuffled Simpkin on the window-sill; while the little mice inside sprang to their feet, and all began to shout all at once in little twittering voices: "No more twist!
noemo	fairytale_sentences	No more twist!"
noemo	fairytale_sentences	And they barred up the window-shutters and shut out Simpkin.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	Simpkin came away from the shop and went home considering in his mind.
joy	fairytale_sentences	He found the poor old tailor without fever, sleeping peacefully.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	The sun was shining on the snow when the tailor got up and dressed, and came out into the street with Simpkin running before him.
sadness	fairytale_sentences	"Alack," said the tailor, "I have my twist; but no more strength--nor time--than will serve to make me one single buttonhole; for this is Christmas Day in the Morning!
sadness	fairytale_sentences	The Mayor of Gloucester shall be married by noon--and where is his cherry- coloured coat?"
noemo	fairytale_sentences	He unlocked the door of the little shop in Westgate Street, and Simpkin ran in, like a cat that expects something.
surprise	fairytale_sentences	But there was no one there!
surprise	fairytale_sentences	Not even one little brown mouse!
noemo	fairytale_sentences	Everything was finished except just one single cherry-coloured buttonhole, and where that buttonhole was wanting there was pinned a scrap of paper with these words--in little teeny weeny writing--
noemo	fairytale_sentences	NO MORE TWIST.
joy	fairytale_sentences	And from then began the luck of the Tailor of Gloucester; he grew quite stout, and he grew quite rich.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	He made the most wonderful waistcoats for all the rich merchants of Gloucester, and for all the fine gentlemen of the country round.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	Never were seen such ruffles, or such embroidered cuffs and lappets!
noemo	fairytale_sentences	But his buttonholes were the greatest triumph of it all.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	The stitches of those buttonholes were so neat--SO neat--I wonder how they could be stitched by an old man in spectacles, with crooked old fingers, and a tailor's thimble.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	The stitches of those buttonholes were so small--SO small--they looked as if they had been made by little mice!
noemo	fairytale_sentences	It is said that the effect of eating too much lettuce is "soporific."
noemo	fairytale_sentences	I have never felt sleepy after eating lettuces; but then I am not a rabbit.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	They certainly had a very soporific effect upon the Flopsy Bunnies!
noemo	fairytale_sentences	When Benjamin Bunny grew up, he married his Cousin Flopsy.
joy	fairytale_sentences	They had a large family, and they were very improvident and cheerful.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	I do not remember the separate names of their children; they were generally called the "Flopsy Bunnies."
noemo	fairytale_sentences	As there was not always quite enough to eat,--Benjamin used to borrow cabbages from Flopsy's brother, Peter Rabbit, who kept a nursery garden.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	Sometimes Peter Rabbit had no cabbages to spare.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	When this happened, the Flopsy Bunnies went across the field to a rubbish heap, in the ditch outside Mr. McGregor's garden.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	Mr. McGregor's rubbish heap was a mixture.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	There were jam pots and paper bags, and mountains of chopped grass from the mowing machine (which always tasted oily), and some rotten vegetable marrows and an old boot or two.
joy	fairytale_sentences	One day--oh joy!--there were a quantity of overgrown lettuces, which had "shot" into flower.
joy	fairytale_sentences	The Flopsy Bunnies simply stuffed themselves with lettuces.
joy	fairytale_sentences	By degrees, one after another, they were overcome with slumber, and lay down in the mown grass.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	Benjamin was not so much overcome as his children.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	Before going to sleep he was sufficiently wide awake to put a paper bag over his head to keep off the flies.
joy	fairytale_sentences	The little Flopsy Bunnies slept delightfully in the warm sun.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	From the lawn beyond the garden came the distant clacketty sound of the mowing machine.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	The blue- bottles buzzed about the wall, and a little old mouse picked over the rubbish among the jam pots.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	(I can tell you her name, she was called Thomasina Tittle- mouse, a woodmouse with a long tail.)
noemo	fairytale_sentences	She rustled across the paper bag, and awakened Benjamin Bunny.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	The mouse apologized profusely, and said that she knew Peter Rabbit.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	While she and Benjamin were talking, close under the wall, they heard a heavy tread above their heads; and suddenly Mr. McGregor emptied out a sackful of lawn mowings right upon the top of the sleeping Flopsy Bunnies!
fear	fairytale_sentences	Benjamin shrank down under his paper bag.
fear	fairytale_sentences	The mouse hid in a jam pot.
joy	fairytale_sentences	The little rabbits smiled sweetly in their sleep under the shower of grass; they did not awake because the lettuces had been so soporific.
joy	fairytale_sentences	They dreamt that their mother Flopsy was tucking them up in a hay bed.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	Mr. McGregor looked down after emptying his sack.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	He saw some funny little brown tips of ears sticking up through the lawn mowings.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	He stared at them for some time.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	Presently a fly settled on one of them and it moved.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	Mr. McGregor climbed down on to the rubbish heap--
anger	fairytale_sentences	"One, two, three, four! five! six leetle rabbits!" said he as he dropped them into his sack.
joy	fairytale_sentences	The Flopsy Bunnies dreamt that their mother was turning them over in bed.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	They stirred a little in their sleep, but still they did not wake up.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	Mr. McGregor tied up the sack and left it on the wall.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	He went to put away the mowing machine.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	While he was gone, Mrs. Flopsy Bunny (who had remained at home) came across the field.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	Then the mouse came out of her jam pot, and Benjamin took the paper bag off his head, and they told the doleful tale.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	But Mrs. Tittlemouse was a resourceful person.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	She nibbled a hole in the bottom corner of the sack.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	The little rabbits were pulled out and pinched to wake them.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	Their parents stuffed the empty sack with three rotten vegetable marrows, an old blackingbrush and two decayed turnips.
fear	fairytale_sentences	Then they all hid under a bush and watched for Mr. McGregor.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	Mr. McGregor came back and picked up the sack, and carried it off.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	He carried it hanging down, as if it were rather heavy.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	The Flopsy Bunnies followed at a safe distance.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	They watched him go into his house.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	And then they crept up to the window to listen.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	Mr. McGregor threw down the sack on the stone floor in a way that would have been extremely painful to the Flopsy Bunnies, if they had happened to have been inside it.
joy	fairytale_sentences	They could hear him drag his chair on the flags, and chuckle--
joy	fairytale_sentences	"One, two, three, four, five, six leetle rabbits!" said Mr. McGregor.
surprise	fairytale_sentences	"Eh?
surprise	fairytale_sentences	What's that?
surprise	fairytale_sentences	What have they been spoiling now?" enquired Mrs. McGregor.
surprise	fairytale_sentences	"One, two, three, four, five, six leetle fat rabbits!" repeated Mr. McGregor, counting on his fingers --"one, two, three--"
disgust	fairytale_sentences	"Don't you be silly: what do you mean, you silly old man?"
surprise	fairytale_sentences	"In the sack! one, two, three, four, five, six!" replied Mr. McGregor.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	(The youngest Flopsy Bunny got upon the windowsill.)
noemo	fairytale_sentences	Mrs. McGregor took hold of the sack and felt it.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	She said she could feel six, but they must be OLD rabbits, because they were so hard and all different shapes.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	"Not fit to eat; but the skins will do fine to line my old cloak."
disgust	fairytale_sentences	"Line your old cloak?" shouted Mr. McGregor--"I shall sell them and buy myself baccy!"
noemo	fairytale_sentences	"Rabbit tobacco!
joy	fairytale_sentences	I shall skin them and cut off their heads."
noemo	fairytale_sentences	Mrs. McGregor untied the sack and put her hand inside.
anger	fairytale_sentences	When she felt the vegetables she became very very angry.
anger	fairytale_sentences	She said that Mr. McGregor had "done it a purpose."
anger	fairytale_sentences	And Mr. McGregor was very angry too.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	One of the rotten marrows came flying through the kitchen window, and hit the youngest Flopsy Bunny.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	Then Benjamin and Flopsy thought that it was time to go home.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	So Mr. McGregor did not get his tobacco, and Mrs. McGregor did not get her rabbit skins.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	But next Christmas Thomasina Tittlemouse got a present of enough rabbit wool to make herself a cloak and a hood, and a handsome muff and a pair of warm mittens.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	What a funny sight it is to see a brood of ducklings with a hen!
anger	fairytale_sentences	Listen to the story of Jemima Puddle-duck, who was annoyed because the farmer's wife would not let her hatch her own eggs.
anger	fairytale_sentences	Her sister-in-law, Mrs. Rebeccah Puddle-duck, was perfectly willing to leave the hatching to someone else-- "I have not the patience to sit on a nest for twenty-eight days; and no more have you, Jemima.
anger	fairytale_sentences	You would let them go cold; you know you would!"
anger	fairytale_sentences	"I wish to hatch my own eggs; I will hatch them all by myself," quacked Jemima Puddle-duck.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	She tried to hide her eggs; but they were always found and carried off.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	She determined to make a nest right away from the farm.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	She set off on a fine spring afternoon along the cart road that leads over the hill.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	She was wearing a shawl and a poke bonnet.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	When she reached the top of the hill, she saw a wood in the distance.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	She thought that it looked a safe quiet spot.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	Jemima Puddle-duck was not much in the habit of flying.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	She ran downhill a few yards flapping her shawl, and then she jumped off into the air.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	She flew beautifully when she had got a good start.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	She skimmed along over the treetops until she saw an open place in the middle of the wood, where the trees and brushwood had been cleared.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	Jemima alighted rather heavily and began to waddle about in search of a convenient dry nesting place.
joy	fairytale_sentences	She rather fancied a tree stump amongst some tall foxgloves.
surprise	fairytale_sentences	But--seated upon the stump, she was startled to find an elegantly dressed gentleman reading a newspaper.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	He had black prick ears and sandy colored whiskers.
fear	fairytale_sentences	"Quack?" said Jemima Puddle- duck, with her head and her bonnet on the one side--"Quack?"
noemo	fairytale_sentences	The gentleman raised his eyes above his newspaper and looked curiously at Jemima--
noemo	fairytale_sentences	"Madam, have you lost your way?" said he.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	He had a long bushy tail which he was sitting upon, as the stump was somewhat damp.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	Jemima thought him mighty civil and handsome.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	She explained that she had not lost her way, but that she was trying to find a convenient dry nesting place.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	"Ah! is that so?
joy	fairytale_sentences	Indeed!" said the gentleman with sandy whiskers, looking curiously at Jemima.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	He folded up the newspaper and put it in his coattail pocket.
anger	fairytale_sentences	Jemima complained of the superfluous hen.
joy	fairytale_sentences	"Indeed!
joy	fairytale_sentences	How interesting!
noemo	fairytale_sentences	I wish I could meet with that fowl.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	I would teach it to mind its own business!
noemo	fairytale_sentences	"But as to a nest--there is no difficulty: I have a sackful of feathers in my woodshed.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	No, my dear madam, you will be in nobody's way.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	You may sit there as long as you like," said the bushy long-tailed gentleman.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	He led the way to a very retired, dismal-looking house amongst the foxgloves.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	It was built of faggots and turf, and there were two broken pails, one on top of another, by way of a chimney.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	"This is my summer residence; you would not find my earth--my winter house--so convenient," said the hospitable gentleman.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	There was a tumbledown shed at the back of the house, made of old soap boxes.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	The gentleman opened the door and showed Jemima in.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	The shed was almost quite full of feathers--it was almost suffocating; but it was comfortable and very soft.
surprise	fairytale_sentences	Jemima Puddle-duck was rather surprised to find such a vast quantity of feathers.
surprise	fairytale_sentences	But it was very comfortable; and she made a nest without any trouble at all.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	When she came out, the sandy- whiskered gentleman was sitting on a log reading the newspaper--at least he had it spread out, but he was looking over the top of it.
sadness	fairytale_sentences	He was so polite that he seemed almost sorry to let Jemima go home for the night.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	He promised to take great care of her nest until she came back again the next day.
joy	fairytale_sentences	He said he loved eggs and ducklings; he should be proud to see a fine nestful in his woodshed.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	Jemima Puddle-duck came every afternoon; she laid nine eggs in the nest.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	They were greeny white and very large.
joy	fairytale_sentences	The foxy gentleman admired them immensely.
joy	fairytale_sentences	He used to turn them over and count them when Jemima was not there.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	At last Jemima told him that she intended to begin to sit next day--"and I will bring a bag of corn with me, so that I need never leave my nest until the eggs are hatched.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	They might catch cold," said the conscientious Jemima.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	"Madam, I beg you not to trouble yourself with a bag; I will provide oats.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	But before you commence your tedious sitting, I intend to give you a treat.
joy	fairytale_sentences	Let us have a dinner party all to ourselves!
noemo	fairytale_sentences	"May I ask you to bring up some herbs from the farm garden to make a savory omelet?
noemo	fairytale_sentences	Sage and thyme, and mint and two onions, and some parsley.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	I will provide lard for the stuff--lard for the omelet," said the hospitable gentleman with sandy whiskers.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	Jemima Puddle-duck was a simpleton: not even the mention of sage and onions made her suspicious.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	She went round the farm garden, nibbling off snippets of all the different sorts of herbs that are used for stuffing roast duck.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	And she waddled into the kitchen and got two onions out of a basket.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	The collie dog Kep met her coming out, "What are you doing with those onions?
noemo	fairytale_sentences	Where do you go every afternoon by yourself, Jemima Puddle-duck?"
joy	fairytale_sentences	The collie listened, with his wise head on one side; he grinned when she described the polite gentleman with sandy whiskers.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	He asked several questions about the wood and about the exact position of the house and shed.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	Then he went out, and trotted down the village.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	He went to look for two foxhound puppies who were out at walk with the butcher.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	Jemima Puddle-duck went up the cart road for the last time, on a sunny afternoon.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	She was rather burdened with bunches of herbs and two onions in a bag.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	She flew over the wood, and alighted opposite the house of the bushy long-tailed gentleman.
fear	fairytale_sentences	He was sitting on a log; he sniffed the air and kept glancing uneasily round the wood.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	"Come into the house as soon as you have looked at your eggs.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	Give me the herbs for the omelet.
anger	fairytale_sentences	Be sharp!"
fear	fairytale_sentences	He was rather abrupt.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	Jemima Puddle-duck had never heard him speak like that.
surprise	fairytale_sentences	She felt surprised and uncomfortable.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	While she was inside she heard pattering feet round the back of the shed.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	Someone with a black nose sniffed at the bottom of the door, and them locked it.
fear	fairytale_sentences	Jemima became much alarmed.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	A moment afterward there were most awful noises--barking, baying, growls and howls, squealing and groans.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	And nothing more was ever seen of that foxy-whiskered gentleman.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	Presently Kep opened the door of the shed and let out Jemima Puddle- duck.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	Unfortunately the puppies rushed in and gobbled up all the eggs before he could stop them.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	He had a bite on his ear, and both the puppies were limping.
sadness	fairytale_sentences	Jemima Puddle-duck was escorted home in tears on account of those eggs.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	She laid some more in June, and she was permitted to keep them herself: but only four of them hatched.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	Jemima Puddle-duck said that it was because of her nerves; but she had always been a bad sitter.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	Once upon a time there was a little girl called Lucie, who lived at a farm called Little-town.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	She was a good little girl--only she was always losing her pocket-handkerchiefs!
sadness	fairytale_sentences	One day little Lucie came into the farm-yard crying--oh, she did cry so!
sadness	fairytale_sentences	"I've lost my pocket-handkin!
sadness	fairytale_sentences	Three handkins and a pinny!
sadness	fairytale_sentences	Have YOU seen them, Tabby Kitten?"
noemo	fairytale_sentences	The Kitten went on washing her white paws; so Lucie asked a speckled hen--
sadness	fairytale_sentences	"Sally Henny-penny, have YOU found three pocket-handkins?"
noemo	fairytale_sentences	But the speckled hen ran into a barn, clucking--
noemo	fairytale_sentences	"I go barefoot, barefoot, barefoot!"
noemo	fairytale_sentences	And then Lucie asked Cock Robin sitting on a twig.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	Cock Robin looked sideways at Lucie with his bright black eye, and he flew over a stile and away.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	Lucie climbed upon the stile and looked up at the hill behind Little- town--a hill that goes up--up--into the clouds as though it had no top!
surprise	fairytale_sentences	And a great way up the hillside she thought she saw some white things spread upon the grass.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	Lucie scrambled up the hill as fast as her short legs would carry her; she ran along a steep path-way--up and up--until Little-town was right away down below--she could have dropped a pebble down the chimney!
noemo	fairytale_sentences	Presently she came to a spring, bubbling out from the hillside.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	Some one had stood a tin can upon a stone to catch the water--but the water was already running over, for the can was no bigger than an egg- cup!
noemo	fairytale_sentences	And where the sand upon the path was wet--there were footmarks of a VERY small person.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	Lucie ran on, and on.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	The path ended under a big rock.
surprise	fairytale_sentences	The grass was short and green, and there were clothes-props cut from bracken stems, with lines of plaited rushes, and a heap of tiny clothes pins--but no pocket-handkerchiefs!
noemo	fairytale_sentences	But there was something else--a door! straight into the hill; and inside it some one was singing--
noemo	fairytale_sentences	"Lily-white and clean, oh!
noemo	fairytale_sentences	With little frills between, oh!
noemo	fairytale_sentences	Smooth and hot-red rusty spot Never here be seen, oh!"
noemo	fairytale_sentences	Lucie knocked-once-twice, and interrupted the song.
fear	fairytale_sentences	A little frightened voice called out "Who's that?"
noemo	fairytale_sentences	Lucie opened the door: and what do you think there was inside the hill?--a nice clean kitchen with a flagged floor and wooden beams-- just like any other farm kitchen.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	Only the ceiling was so low that Lucie's head nearly touched it; and the pots and pans were small, and so was everything there.
fear	fairytale_sentences	There was a nice hot singey smell; and at the table, with an iron in her hand, stood a very stout short person staring anxiously at Lucie.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	Her print gown was tucked up, and she was wearing a large apron over her striped petticoat.
surprise	fairytale_sentences	Her little black nose went sniffle, sniffle, snuffle, and her eyes went twinkle, twinkle; and underneath her cap-where Lucie had yellow curls-that little person had PRICKLES!
noemo	fairytale_sentences	"Who are you?" said Lucie.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	"Have you seen my pocket-handkins?"
joy	fairytale_sentences	The little person made a bob- curtsey--"Oh yes, if you please'm; my name is Mrs. Tiggy-winkle; oh yes if you please'm, I'm an excellent clear- starcher!"
noemo	fairytale_sentences	And she took something out of the clothesbasket, and spread it on the ironing-blanket.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	"What's that thing?" said Lucie- "that's not my pocket-handkin?"
noemo	fairytale_sentences	"Oh no, if you please'm; that's a little scarlet waist-coat belonging to Cock Robin!"
noemo	fairytale_sentences	And she ironed it and folded it, and put it on one side.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	Then she took something else off a clothes-horse--"That isn't my pinny?" said Lucie.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	"Oh no, if you please'm; that's a damask table-cloth belonging to Jenny Wren; look how it's stained with currant wine!
disgust	fairytale_sentences	It's very bad to wash!" said Mrs. Tiggy-winkle.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	Mrs. Tiggy-winkle's nose went sniffle sniffle snuffle, and her eyes went twinkle twinkle; and she fetched another hot iron from the fire.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	Mrs. Tiggy-winkle ironed it, and goffered it, and shook out the frills.
joy	fairytale_sentences	"Oh that IS lovely!" said Lucie.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	"And what are those long yellow things with fingers like gloves?"
noemo	fairytale_sentences	"Oh that's a pair of stockings belonging to Sally Henny-penny--look how she's worn the heels out with scratching in the yard!
noemo	fairytale_sentences	She'll very soon go barefoot!" said Mrs. Tiggy-winkle.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	"Why, there's another hankersniff-- but it isn't mine; it's red?"
disgust	fairytale_sentences	"Oh no, if you please'm; that one belongs to old Mrs. Rabbit; and it DID so smell of onions!
disgust	fairytale_sentences	I've had to wash it separately, I can't get out that smell."
surprise	fairytale_sentences	"There's another one of mine," said Lucie.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	"What are those funny little white things?"
noemo	fairytale_sentences	"That's a pair of mittens belonging to Tabby Kitten; I only have to iron them; she washes them herself."
surprise	fairytale_sentences	"There's my last pocket-handkin!" said Lucie.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	"And what are you dipping into the basin of starch?"
noemo	fairytale_sentences	"They're little dicky shirt-fronts belonging to Tom Titmouse--most terrible particular!" said Mrs. Tiggy- winkle.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	"Now I've finished my ironing; I'm going to air some clothes."
noemo	fairytale_sentences	"What are these dear soft fluffy things?" said Lucie.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	"Oh those are woolly coats belonging to the little lambs at Skelghyl."
noemo	fairytale_sentences	"Will their jackets take off?" asked Lucie.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	"Oh yes, if you please'm; look at the sheep-mark on the shoulder.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	And here's one marked for Gatesgarth, and three that come from Little-town.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	They're ALWAYS marked at washing!" said Mrs. Tiggy-winkle.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	And she hung up all sorts and sizes of clothes--small brown coats of mice; and one velvety black moleskin waist-coat; and a red tail-coat with no tail belonging to Squirrel Nutkin; and a very much shrunk blue jacket belonging to Peter Rabbit; and a petticoat, not marked, that had gone lost in the washing--and at last the basket was empty!
noemo	fairytale_sentences	Then Mrs. Tiggy-winkle made tea--a cup for herself and a cup for Lucie.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	They sat before the fire on a bench and looked sideways at one another.
disgust	fairytale_sentences	Mrs. Tiggy-winkle's hand, holding the tea-cup, was very very brown, and very very wrinkly with the soap-suds; and all through her gown and her cap, there were HAIRPINS sticking wrong end out; so that Lucie didn't like to sit too near her.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	When they had finished tea, they tied up the clothes in bundles; and Lucie's pocket-handkerchiefs were folded up inside her clean pinny, and fastened with a silver safety-pin.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	And then they made up the fire with turf, and came out and locked the door, and hid the key under the door-sill.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	Then away down the hill trotted Lucie and Mrs. Tiggy-winkle with the bundles of clothes!
noemo	fairytale_sentences	All the way down the path little animals came out of the fern to meet them; the very first that they met were Peter Rabbit and Benjamin Bunny!
joy	fairytale_sentences	And she gave them their nice clean clothes; and all the little animals and birds were so very much obliged to dear Mrs. Tiggy-winkle.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	So that at the bottom of the hill when they came to the stile, there was nothing left to carry except Lucie's one little bundle.
surprise	fairytale_sentences	Lucie scrambled up the stile with the bundle in her hand; and then she turned to say "Good-night," and to thank the washer-woman.--But what a VERY odd thing!
surprise	fairytale_sentences	Mrs. Tiggy-winkle had not waited either for thanks or for the washing bill!
noemo	fairytale_sentences	She was running running running up the hill--and where was her white frilled cap? and her shawl? and her gown-and her petticoat?
noemo	fairytale_sentences	And HOW small she had grown-- and HOW brown--and covered with PRICKLES!
noemo	fairytale_sentences	Why!
surprise	fairytale_sentences	Mrs. Tiggy-winkle was nothing but a HEDGEHOG! * * * * * *
noemo	fairytale_sentences	(Now some people say that little Lucie had been asleep upon the stile--but then how could she have found three clean pocket-handkins and a pinny, pinned with a silver safety-pin?
noemo	fairytale_sentences	And besides--I have seen that door into the back of the hill called Cat Bells--and besides _I_ am very well acquainted with dear Mrs. Tiggy-winkle!)
noemo	fairytale_sentences	One morning a little rabbit sat on a bank.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	He pricked his ears and listened to the trit-trot, trit-trot of a pony.
noemo	fairytale_sentences	A gig was coming along the road; it was driven by Mr. McGregor, and beside him sat Mrs. McGregor in her best bonnet.
surprise	fairytale_sentences	He came round the back of the fir- tree, and nearly tumbled upon the top of his Cousin Peter.
sadness	fairytale_sentences	He looked poorly, and was dressed in a red cotton pocket-handkerchief.
sadness	fairytale_sentences	Peter replied, "The scarecrow in Mr. McGregor's garden," and described how he had been chased about the garden, and had dropped his shoes and coat.
fear	fairytale_sentences	Peter did not seem to be enjoying himself; he kept hearing noises.
joy	fairytale_sentences	Benjamin, on the contrary, was perfectly at home, and ate a lettuce leaf.
fear	fairytale_sentences	Peter did not eat anything; he said he should like to go home.
joy	fairytale_sentences	He led the way boldly towards the other end of the garden.
joy	fairytale_sentences	The mice sat on their doorsteps cracking cherry-stones; they winked at Peter Rabbit and little Benjamin Bunny.
fear	fairytale_sentences	Peter heard noises worse than ever; his eyes were as big as lolly-pops!
fear	fairytale_sentences	I cannot draw you a picture of Peter and Benjamin underneath the basket, because it was quite dark, and because the smell of onions was fearful; it made Peter Rabbit and little Benjamin cry.
surprise	fairytale_sentences	The cat was too much surprised to scratch back.
anger	fairytale_sentences	Then he came back to the basket and took out his son Benjamin by the ears, and whipped him with the little switch.
surprise	fairytale_sentences	When Mr. McGregor returned about half an hour later he observed several things which perplexed him.
surprise	fairytale_sentences	Also he could not understand how the cat could have managed to shut herself up INSIDE the greenhouse, locking the door upon the OUTSIDE.
joy	fairytale_sentences	When Peter got home his mother forgave him, because she was so glad to see that he had found his shoes and coat.
fear	fairytale_sentences	Tom Thumb and Hunca Munca went cautiously across the hearthrug.
joy	fairytale_sentences	Then they squeaked with joy!
surprise	fairytale_sentences	The knife crumpled up and hurt him; he put his finger in his mouth.
surprise	fairytale_sentences	"It is not boiled enough; it is hard.
disgust	fairytale_sentences	"It's as hard as the hams at the cheesemonger's," said Hunca Munca.
anger	fairytale_sentences	Then Tom Thumb lost his temper.
anger	fairytale_sentences	Then there was no end to the rage and disappointment of Tom Thumb and Hunca Munca.
anger	fairytale_sentences	Then those mice set to work to do all the mischief they could--especially Tom Thumb!
fear	fairytale_sentences	The mice rushed back to their hole, and the dolls came into the nursery.
surprise	fairytale_sentences	What a sight met the eyes of Jane and Lucinda!
sadness	fairytale_sentences	Lucinda sat upon the upset kitchen stove and stared; and Jane leant against the kitchen dresser and smiled--but neither of them made any remark.
joy	fairytale_sentences	The little girl that the doll's-house belonged to, said,--"I will get a doll dressed like a policeman!"
disgust	fairytale_sentences	But the nurse said,--"I will set a mouse-trap!"
fear	fairytale_sentences	The good Rabbit creeps away and hides in a hole.
sadness	fairytale_sentences	It feels sad.
joy	fairytale_sentences	He thinks it is a very funny bird!
disgust	fairytale_sentences	The rabbits could not bear him; they could smell him half a mile off.
fear	fairytale_sentences	One day he was living in a stick- house in the coppice [grove], causing terror to the family of old Mr. Benjamin Bouncer.
fear	fairytale_sentences	Next day he moved into a pollard willow near the lake, frightening the wild ducks and the water rats.
anger	fairytale_sentences	He was friendly with old Mr. Bouncer; they agreed in disliking the wicked otters and Mr. Tod; they often talked over that painful subject.
anger	fairytale_sentences	He complained bitterly about the scarcity of pheasants' eggs, and accused Mr. Tod of poaching them.
anger	fairytale_sentences	And the otters had cleared off all the frogs while he was asleep in winter--"I have not had a good square meal for a fort- night, I am living on pig-nuts.
anger	fairytale_sentences	I shall have to turn vegetarian and eat my own tail!" said Tommy Brock.
joy	fairytale_sentences	It was not much of a joke, but it tickled old Mr. Bouncer; because Tommy Brock was so fat and stumpy and grinning.
joy	fairytale_sentences	So old Mr. Bouncer laughed; and pressed Tommy Brock to come inside, to taste a slice of seed cake and "a glass of my daughter Flopsy's cowslip wine."
joy	fairytale_sentences	Then old Mr. Bouncer smoked another pipe, and gave Tommy Brock a cabbage leaf cigar which was so very strong that it made Tommy Brock grin more than ever; and the smoke filled the burrow.
joy	fairytale_sentences	Old Mr. Bouncer coughed and laughed; and Tommy Brock puffed and grinned.
joy	fairytale_sentences	And Mr. Bouncer laughed and coughed, and shut his eyes because of the cabbage smoke ..........
fear	fairytale_sentences	Mr. Bouncer would not confess that he had admitted anybody into the rabbit hole.
anger	fairytale_sentences	Benjamin Bunny set off at once after Tommy Brock.
fear	fairytale_sentences	Benjamin stamped his foot, and bolted.
joy	fairytale_sentences	Other rabbits were coming out to enjoy the evening air.
surprise	fairytale_sentences	Peter Rabbit, Peter Rabbit!" shouted Benjamin Bunny.
surprise	fairytale_sentences	The blue coated rabbit sat up with pricked ears--"Whatever is the matter, Cousin Benjamin?
surprise	fairytale_sentences	Is it a cat? or John Stoat Ferret?"
fear	fairytale_sentences	"No, no, no!
fear	fairytale_sentences	He's bagged my family--Tommy Brock--in a sack --have you seen him?"
surprise	fairytale_sentences	"Tommy Brock? how many, Cousin Benjamin?"
fear	fairytale_sentences	"Seven, Cousin Peter, and all of them twins!
fear	fairytale_sentences	Did he come this way?
fear	fairytale_sentences	Please tell me quick!"
fear	fairytale_sentences	"Which way? which way has he gone, Cousin Peter?"
sadness	fairytale_sentences	"My Uncle Bouncer has displayed a lamentable want of discretion for his years;" said Peter reflectively, "but there are two hopeful circumstances.
fear	fairytale_sentences	"Which way?"
fear	fairytale_sentences	Peter hid his dandelions, and accompanied the afflicted parent, who was all of atwitter.
surprise	fairytale_sentences	"He must be very puffed; we are close behind him, by the scent.
disgust	fairytale_sentences	What a nasty person!" said Peter.
fear	fairytale_sentences	He had nodded, and pointed to the sack, and seemed doubled up with laughing.--"Come away, Peter; he will be cooking them; come quicker!" said Benjamin Bunny.
fear	fairytale_sentences	Come on, Cousin Benjamin!"
fear	fairytale_sentences	When they came near the wood at the top of Bull Banks, they went cautiously.
fear	fairytale_sentences	The rabbits crept up carefully, listening and peeping.
joy	fairytale_sentences	Benjamin sighed with relief.
fear	fairytale_sentences	The rabbits shivered in their shoes.
fear	fairytale_sentences	Benjamin, who was all of atwitter, pulled Peter off the windowsill.
fear	fairytale_sentences	There were many unpleasant things lying about that had much better have been buried; rabbit bones and skulls, and chickens' legs and other horrors.
sadness	fairytale_sentences	But alas, no little rabbit babies were to be seen!
surprise	fairytale_sentences	And presently at the same moment Peter and Benjamin noticed that whenever they shook the window the little door opposite shook in answer.
surprise	fairytale_sentences	The young family were alive; shut up in the oven!
joy	fairytale_sentences	Benjamin was so excited that it was a mercy he did not awake Tommy Brock, whose snores continued solemnly in Mr. Tod's bed.
fear	fairytale_sentences	Then those two rabbits lost their heads completely.
fear	fairytale_sentences	They rushed into their short new tunnel, and hid themselves at the top end of it, under Mr. Tod's kitchen floor.
anger	fairytale_sentences	Mr. Tod was coming up Bull Banks, and he was in the very worst of tempers.
anger	fairytale_sentences	First he had been upset by breaking the plate.
anger	fairytale_sentences	Then the midges had been very bad.
anger	fairytale_sentences	And he had failed to catch a hen pheasant on her nest; and it had contained only five eggs, two of them addled.
anger	fairytale_sentences	Mr. Tod had had an unsatisfactory night.
anger	fairytale_sentences	As usual, when out of humor, he determined to move house.
anger	fairytale_sentences	He made his way up the hill; his temper was not improved by noticing unmistakable marks of badger.
anger	fairytale_sentences	Mr. Tod slapped his stick upon the earth and fumed; he guessed where Tommy Brock had gone to.
anger	fairytale_sentences	He was further annoyed by the jay bird which followed him persistently.
anger	fairytale_sentences	Once when it flew screaming over his head Mr. Tod snapped at it, and barked.
anger	fairytale_sentences	The sight that met Mr. Tod's eyes in Mr. Tod's kitchen made Mr. Tod furious.
anger	fairytale_sentences	His whiskers bristled and his coat collar stood on end with rage.
anger	fairytale_sentences	When he was outside the house, he scratched up the earth with fury.
fear	fairytale_sentences	But when he was inside --he did not like the look of Tommy Brock's teeth.
disgust	fairytale_sentences	He was an incurably indolent person; he was not in the least afraid of Mr. Tod; he was simply too lazy and comfortable to move.
surprise	fairytale_sentences	It creaked; he turned round with a jump.
fear	fairytale_sentences	The snores were almost apoplectic; but the grin was not quite so big.
joy	fairytale_sentences	"I will wake him up with an unpleasant surprise," said Mr. Tod.
joy	fairytale_sentences	The moment he had gone, Tommy Brock got up in a hurry; he rolled Mr. Tod's dressing-gown into a bundle, put it into the bed beneath the pail of water instead of himself, and left the room also-- grinning immensely.
surprise	fairytale_sentences	At last the rope gave way with such a sudden jerk that it nearly pulled his teeth out, and quite knocked him over backwards.
joy	fairytale_sentences	Yes--there was no doubt about it--it had turned out even better than he had planned; the pail had hit poor old Tommy Brock, and killed him dead!
joy	fairytale_sentences	"I will bury that nasty person in the hole which he has dug.
disgust	fairytale_sentences	I must have a disinfecting.
joy	fairytale_sentences	He was quite dry himself and grinning; and he threw the cup of scalding tea all over Mr. Tod.
anger	fairytale_sentences	Then Mr. Tod rushed upon Tommy Brock, and Tommy Brock grappled with Mr. Tod amongst the broken crockery, and there was a terrific battle all over the kitchen.
fear	fairytale_sentences	To the rabbits underneath it sounded as if the floor would give way at each crash of falling furniture.
fear	fairytale_sentences	They crept out of their tunnel, and hung about amongst the rocks and bushes, listening anxiously.
fear	fairytale_sentences	Inside the house the racket was fearful.
fear	fairytale_sentences	The rabbit babies in the oven woke up trembling; perhaps it was fortunate they were shut up inside.
joy	fairytale_sentences	When the kettle fell, Tommy Brock, who was still grinning, happened to be uppermost; and he rolled Mr. Tod over and over like a log, out at the door.
anger	fairytale_sentences	Then the snarling and worrying went on outside; and they rolled over the bank, and down hill, bumping over the rocks.
anger	fairytale_sentences	There will never be any love lost between Tommy Brock and Mr. Tod.
joy	fairytale_sentences	"Now for it!
joy	fairytale_sentences	Run in, Cousin Benjamin!
joy	fairytale_sentences	Run in and get them! while I watch the door."
fear	fairytale_sentences	But Benjamin was frightened--
fear	fairytale_sentences	"Oh; oh! they are coming back!"
fear	fairytale_sentences	"Yes they are!"
anger	fairytale_sentences	At home in the rabbit hole, things had not been quite comfortable.
anger	fairytale_sentences	After quarreling at supper, Flopsy and old Mr. Bouncer had passed a sleepless night, and quarrelled again at breakfast.
anger	fairytale_sentences	Old Mr. Bouncer could no longer deny that he had invited company into the rabbit hole; but he refused to reply to the questions and reproaches of Flopsy.
anger	fairytale_sentences	Old Mr. Bouncer, very sulky, was huddled up in a corner, barricaded with a chair.
fear	fairytale_sentences	Old Mr. Bouncer, behind his chair, was wondering anxiously what she would do next.
fear	fairytale_sentences	In Mr. Tod's kitchen, amidst the wreckage, Benjamin Bunny picked his way to the oven nervously, through a thick cloud of dust.
joy	fairytale_sentences	"I've got them!
joy	fairytale_sentences	Great was old Mr. Bouncer's relief and Flopsy's joy when Peter and Benjamin arrived in triumph with the young family.
sadness	fairytale_sentences	The rabbit babies were rather tumbled and very hungry; they were fed and put to bed.
joy	fairytale_sentences	He was rather upon his dignity; but he accepted.
joy	fairytale_sentences	Old Mr. Bouncer was forgiven, and they all had dinner.
joy	fairytale_sentences	The sun shone among the delicate leaves; everything breathed forth the loveliest fragrance, and all felt as we do when we are filled with joy at the thought of our happiness.
joy	fairytale_sentences	"How beautiful existence is!" said each rose.
joy	fairytale_sentences	We have good neighbours, both below and above.
joy	fairytale_sentences	How beautiful existence is!"
disgust	fairytale_sentences	"If you must ask questions, ask sensible ones," said their mother.
disgust	fairytale_sentences	"Don't you see that they are feathers, such as I wear and you will wear too?
surprise	fairytale_sentences	I am very curious to know what the ducks were so startled about; not about us, certainly, although I did say 'peep' to you pretty loudly.
disgust	fairytale_sentences	The thick-headed roses ought to know why, but they know nothing at all; they only look at themselves and smell.
disgust	fairytale_sentences	I am heartily tired of such neighbours."
joy	fairytale_sentences	What a pleasure that must be!
joy	fairytale_sentences	It is fine to have such cheerful neighbours."
surprise	fairytale_sentences	The other roses looked after their sister, and asked each other, "Where can she be going to?"
joy	fairytale_sentences	The whole day long the sun shines bright and warm, and in the night the sky shines more beautifully still; we can see that through all the little holes in it."
joy	fairytale_sentences	"We make it lively about the house," said the sparrow-mother; "and people say that a swallows' nest brings luck; so they are glad of us.
disgust	fairytale_sentences	But such neighbours as ours!
disgust	fairytale_sentences	The roses are good for nothing but to be looked at and to be smelt, or at most to be stuck in a hat.
disgust	fairytale_sentences	You see, that's their life; they exist only for the eye and the nose.
joy	fairytale_sentences	But they were very pleased with it, and wondered whether all the little sparrows could become nightingales.
disgust	fairytale_sentences	"Nothing at all," answered their mother; "that's only something external.
disgust	fairytale_sentences	If they were only plucked a little they would look no better than the rest of us.
disgust	fairytale_sentences	I would have plucked them already if they had not been so big."
joy	fairytale_sentences	In the farmhouse lived a young married couple; they loved each other dearly, were industrious and active, and everything in their home looked very nice.
joy	fairytale_sentences	"Now I see that it is Sunday," said the husband, kissing his little wife.
joy	fairytale_sentences	They sat down, read their hymn-book, and held each other by the hand, while the sun shone down upon the fresh roses and upon them.
disgust	fairytale_sentences	"This sight is really too tedious," said the sparrow-mother, who could see into the room from her nest; and she flew away.
surprise	fairytale_sentences	In one of her flights, however it may have happened, she was caught, before she was aware of it, in a horse-hair net which some boys had attached to a tree.
fear	fairytale_sentences	The horse-hair was drawn tightly round her leg- as tightly as if the latter were to be cut off; she was in great pain and terror.
joy	fairytale_sentences	He was a merry old man, always wandering about.
fear	fairytale_sentences	At these words an icy shudder ran through the sparrow-mother.
fear	fairytale_sentences	But she, trembling in every limb, did not think of the adornment.
fear	fairytale_sentences	"Now you will see the gold-jacket fly," said the old man, letting the sparrow go, which flew away in deadly fear, with the sun shining upon her.
surprise	fairytale_sentences	How she glittered!
surprise	fairytale_sentences	All the sparrows, and even a crow- and an old boy he was too- were startled at the sight; but still they flew after her to learn what kind of strange bird she was.
fear	fairytale_sentences	Driven by fear and horror, she flew homeward; she was almost sinking fainting to the earth, while the flock of pursuing birds increased, some even attempting to peck at her.
surprise	fairytale_sentences	"Look at her!
surprise	fairytale_sentences	Look at her!" they all cried.
surprise	fairytale_sentences	"Look at her!
surprise	fairytale_sentences	Look at her" cried her little ones. as she approached the nest.
surprise	fairytale_sentences	"That is certainly a young peacock, for it glitters in all colours; it makes one's eyes ache, as mother told us.
surprise	fairytale_sentences	Peep! that's 'the beautiful'."
sadness	fairytale_sentences	And then they pecked at the bird with their little beaks so that it was impossible for her to get into the nest; she was so exhausted that she couldn't even say "Peep!" much less "I am your own mother!"
sadness	fairytale_sentences	"Poor creature!" said all the roses; "only be still, and we will hide you.
surprise	fairytale_sentences	The sparrow spread out her wings once more, then drew them closely to her, and lay dead near the neighbouring family, the beautiful fresh roses.
anger	fairytale_sentences	"But I am the eldest!" exclaimed the third.
anger	fairytale_sentences	Then they all got excited; they hit out with their wings, pecked with their beaks, and flop! one after another was thrown out of the nest.
anger	fairytale_sentences	There they lay with their anger, holding their heads on one side and blinking the eye that was turned upwards.
surprise	fairytale_sentences	In the night the red flames burst through the window and seized the roof, the dry straw blazed up high, and the whole house, together with the young sparrow, was burned.
joy	fairytale_sentences	"A pleasanter picture cannot be imagined.
surprise	fairytale_sentences	"Where is the house?" they asked.
surprise	fairytale_sentences	"Where is the nest?
surprise	fairytale_sentences	All is burned and our strong brother too.
disgust	fairytale_sentences	I don't want to talk to them, and it looks miserable here- that's my opinion."
joy	fairytale_sentences	"They are sparrows, and good creatures.
joy	fairytale_sentences	"Here is excellent fare!" said the sparrow.
disgust	fairytale_sentences	"Do you see that pouter pigeon?" said one to the other.
disgust	fairytale_sentences	She eats too many, and the best ones too.
disgust	fairytale_sentences	How she lifts her crest, the ugly, spiteful creature!
sadness	fairytale_sentences	The sparrows ate lustily; they listened attentively, and even stood in the ranks with the others, but it did not suit them at all.
joy	fairytale_sentences	They were full, and so they left the pigeons, exchanging opinions about them, slipped in under the garden palings, and when they found the door leading into the house open, one of them, who was more than full, and therefore felt brave, hopped on to the threshold.
surprise	fairytale_sentences	"Peep!" said the sparrows, "it's nothing.
disgust	fairytale_sentences	It only looks like something.
surprise	fairytale_sentences	Peep! that is 'the beautiful.'
joy	fairytale_sentences	The pigeons had often cooed, not to say growled- the spiteful creatures; the sparrows had been frozen in winter and had lived merrily in summer: they were all betrothed, or married, or whatever you like to call it.
joy	fairytale_sentences	The windows of the house were broader at the bottom than at the top, and when the sparrows looked through them, every room appeared to them like a tulip with the brightest colours and shades.
joy	fairytale_sentences	"How it shines! how it shines!" said the maiden sparrow.
joy	fairytale_sentences	"I suppose that is 'the beautiful.'
surprise	fairytale_sentences	A "peep" and three foot-scrapings- in this way she had often greeted throughout the year, and no one here had responded, for those who are once parted do not meet every day; and so this greeting had become a habit with her.
joy	fairytale_sentences	Good-day! good-day!"
joy	fairytale_sentences	This is 'the beautiful.'
joy	fairytale_sentences	All stood with enraptured faces round Thorwaldsen's grave, and a few picked up the fallen rose-leaves and preserved them.
surprise	fairytale_sentences	"Peep!" they said sweeping the ground with their tails, and blinking with one eye at the roses, they had not looked at them long before they were convinced that they were their old neighbours.
joy	fairytale_sentences	The painter who had drawn the rose-bush near the ruined house, had afterwards obtained permission to dig it up, and had given it to the architect, for finer roses had never been seen.
joy	fairytale_sentences	The roses nodded; they recognized their grey neighbours and were pleased to see them again.
joy	fairytale_sentences	"How glorious it is to live and to bloom, to see old friends again, and happy faces every day.
joy	fairytale_sentences	It is as if every day were a festival."
joy	fairytale_sentences	Peep! how they have got on.
surprise	fairytale_sentences	THERE lived once upon a time a wicked prince whose heart and mind were set upon conquering all the countries of the world, and on frightening the people; he devastated their countries with fire and sword, and his soldiers trod down the crops in the fields and destroyed the peasants' huts by fire, so that the flames licked the green leaves off the branches, and the fruit hung dried up on the singed black trees.
joy	fairytale_sentences	The prince was of opinion that all this was right, and that it was only the natural course which things ought to take.
fear	fairytale_sentences	His power increased day by day, his name was feared by all, and fortune favoured his deeds.
sadness	fairytale_sentences	But they did not know what endless misery he had brought upon other countries, nor did they hear the sighs and lamentations which rose up from the debris of the destroyed cities.
joy	fairytale_sentences	The prince often looked with delight upon his gold and his magnificent edifices, and thought, like the crowd: "What a mighty prince!
joy	fairytale_sentences	No power on earth must equal mine, far less exceed it."
surprise	fairytale_sentences	The conquered kings were chained up with golden fetters to his chariot when he drove through the streets of his city.
sadness	fairytale_sentences	These kings had to kneel at his and his courtiers' feet when they sat at table, and live on the morsels which they left.
disgust	fairytale_sentences	"Then I will conquer God too."
anger	fairytale_sentences	"I will conquer God!" said the prince.
anger	fairytale_sentences	"I have sworn it: my will must be done!"
anger	fairytale_sentences	They buzzed round the prince and stung his face and hands; angrily he drew his sword and brandished it, but he only touched the air and did not hit the gnats.
anger	fairytale_sentences	Mad with pain, he tore off the coverings and his clothes too, flinging them far away, and danced about before the eyes of his ferocious soldiers, who now mocked at him, the mad prince, who wished to make war with God, and was overcome by a single little gnat.
sadness	fairytale_sentences	"Who is the dead man?" we asked.
sadness	fairytale_sentences	"They say that he was once an energetic young man, that he studied the dead languages, and sang and even composed many songs; then something had happened to him, and in consequence of this he gave himself up to drink, body and mind.
sadness	fairytale_sentences	When at last he had ruined his health, they brought him into the country, where someone paid for his board and residence.
anger	fairytale_sentences	He was gentle as a child as long as the sullen mood did not come over him; but when it came he was fierce, became as strong as a giant, and ran about in the wood like a chased deer.
sadness	fairytale_sentences	But when we succeeded in bringing him home, and prevailed upon him to open the book with the dried-up plants in it, he would sometimes sit for a whole day looking at this or that plant, while frequently the tears rolled over his cheeks.
sadness	fairytale_sentences	God knows what was in his mind; but he requested us to put the book into his coffin, and now he lies there.
sadness	fairytale_sentences	In a little while the lid will be placed upon the coffin, and he will have sweet rest in the grave!"
joy	fairytale_sentences	The cloth which covered his face was lifted up; the dead man's face expressed peace- a sunbeam fell upon it.
sadness	fairytale_sentences	What a strange feeling it is- surely we all know it- to look through old letters of our young days; a different life rises up out of the past, as it were, with all its hopes and sorrows.
joy	fairytale_sentences	He fixed the leaf to the student's cap in the green wood, when they vowed eternal friendship.
sadness	fairytale_sentences	Where does he dwell now?
sadness	fairytale_sentences	The leaf is kept, but the friendship does no longer exist.
sadness	fairytale_sentences	Here is a water-lily that he had plucked himself, and watered with salt tears- a lily of sweet water.
sadness	fairytale_sentences	What might he have thought when he plucked and kept it?
sadness	fairytale_sentences	The lilac bends its fresh fragrant flowers over the dead man's head; the swallow passes again- "twit, twit;" now the men come with hammer and nails, the lid is placed over the dead man, while his head rests on the dumb book- so long cherished, now closed for ever!
anger	fairytale_sentences	"He annoys me with his loud crowing," said the Portuguese duck; "but, still, he's a handsome bird, there's no denying that, although he's not a drake.
joy	fairytale_sentences	How sweetly they sing there; it is quite a pleasure to listen to them!
disgust	fairytale_sentences	"That's just like the cat, she's a villain," said the Portuguese duck.
disgust	fairytale_sentences	How can such a creature be allowed to live, and wander about upon the roofs.
sadness	fairytale_sentences	She pitied the little singing-bird, and so did all the other ducks who were not Portuguese.
sadness	fairytale_sentences	"Poor little creature!" they said, one after another, as they came up.
joy	fairytale_sentences	"Tweet, tweet!" said the little bird, for one of his wings being broken, he found it difficult to shake himself; but he quite understood that the bath was meant kindly, and he said, "You are very kind-hearted, madam;" but he did not wish for a second bath.
joy	fairytale_sentences	"I have never thought about my heart," replied the Portuguese duck, "but I know that I love all my fellow-creatures, except the cat, and nobody can expect me to love her, for she ate up two of my ducklings.
disgust	fairytale_sentences	"Don't plague him so, interposed the Portuguese duck; "he requires rest and nursing.
surprise	fairytale_sentences	"Oh, no! no! pray let me dry," implored the little bird.
joy	fairytale_sentences	"Amusement, too, is very beneficial.
joy	fairytale_sentences	The two Chinese were quite enchanted with the appearance of the singing-bird.
joy	fairytale_sentences	"He's charming," they said to each other, and began a conversation with him in whispers, using the most aristocratic Chinese dialect: "We are of the same race as yourself," they said.
disgust	fairytale_sentences	It cannot even be said of the ducks, and we warn you, little bird, not to trust that one yonder, with the short tail feathers, for she is cunning; that curiously marked one, with the crooked stripes on her wings, is a mischief-maker, and never lets any one have the last word, though she is always in the wrong.
disgust	fairytale_sentences	That fat duck yonder speaks evil of every one, and that is against our principles.
anger	fairytale_sentences	"I wonder what those two Chinese are whispering about," whispered one duck to another; "they are always doing it, and it annoys me.
joy	fairytale_sentences	So she laid herself down in the sun and winked with one eye; she had a very comfortable place, and felt so comfortable that she fell asleep.
joy	fairytale_sentences	The sun shone warm and bright, and he found out that it was a very good place.
disgust	fairytale_sentences	The witty little duck said of the Portuguese, that the old lady was getting quite a "doting ducky," All the other ducks laughed at this.
joy	fairytale_sentences	And then they repeated the former joke about "Portulak," and declared it was most amusing.
surprise	fairytale_sentences	The Portuguese awoke too, and rushed over to the other side: in so doing she trod upon the little singing-bird.
anger	fairytale_sentences	"Well, then, why do you lie in my way?" she retorted, "you must not be so touchy.
joy	fairytale_sentences	When she had finished, she lay down again, and the little bird, who wished to be amiable, began to sing,-
anger	fairytale_sentences	"Now I want rest after my dinner," said the Portuguese; "you must conform to the rules of the house while you are here.
anger	fairytale_sentences	When madam awoke afterwards, there he stood before her with a little corn he had found, and laid it at her feet; but as she had not slept well, she was naturally in a bad temper.
anger	fairytale_sentences	"Give that to a chicken," she said, "and don't be always standing in my way."
anger	fairytale_sentences	"Done!" repeated the Portuguese duck, "your mode of expressing yourself is not very polite.
sadness	fairytale_sentences	"It was sunshine here yesterday," said the little bird, "but to-day it is cloudy and the air is close."
fear	fairytale_sentences	"But you are looking at me just as the wicked eyes looked when I fell into the yard yesterday."
anger	fairytale_sentences	"Impertinent creature!" exclaimed the Portuguese duck: "would you compare me with the cat- that beast of prey?
disgust	fairytale_sentences	There's not a drop of malicious blood in me.
anger	fairytale_sentences	So saying, she made a bite at the little singing-bird's head, and he fell dead on the ground.
disgust	fairytale_sentences	"she said; "could he not bear even such a little peck as I gave him?
disgust	fairytale_sentences	Then certainly he was not made for this world.
anger	fairytale_sentences	"You'll kill me with your crowing," she cried, "it's all your fault.
anger	fairytale_sentences	He's lost his life, and I'm very near losing mine."
sadness	fairytale_sentences	There was nothing to envy here, so they all showed a great deal of pity, even the two Chinese.
sadness	fairytale_sentences	"We shall never have another singing-bird again amongst us; he was almost a Chinese," they whispered, and then they wept with such a noisy, clucking sound, that all the other fowls clucked too, but the ducks went about with redder eyes afterwards.
joy	fairytale_sentences	"It must look very grand," thought he, "for my wife to have a sentry guarding her nest.
disgust	fairytale_sentences	"Never mind what they say; you need not listen," said the mother.
disgust	fairytale_sentences	But the boys went on singing and pointing at the storks, and mocking at them, excepting one of the boys whose name was Peter; he said it was a shame to make fun of animals, and would not join with them at all.
fear	fairytale_sentences	"But we are very much frightened," said the young storks, and they drew back their heads into the nests.
fear	fairytale_sentences	"Shall we be hanged and roasted?" asked the young storks.
disgust	fairytale_sentences	"No, certainly not," said the mother.
surprise	fairytale_sentences	"Then we may be killed after all, as the boys say; and hark! they are singing again."
disgust	fairytale_sentences	"Listen to me, and not to them," said the mother stork.
surprise	fairytale_sentences	"Oh, o- h!" cried the young storks.
anger	fairytale_sentences	"I don't want to fly," said one of the young storks, creeping back into the nest.
anger	fairytale_sentences	"I don't care about going to warm countries."
disgust	fairytale_sentences	"Would you like to stay here and freeze when the winter comes?" said the mother, "or till the boys comes to hang you, or to roast you?- Well then, I'll call them."
fear	fairytale_sentences	"Oh no, no," said the young stork, jumping out on the roof with the others; and now they were all attentive, and by the third day could fly a little.
anger	fairytale_sentences	"Shall we fly down, and pick their eyes out?" asked the young storks.
joy	fairytale_sentences	That last flap of the wings was so easy and graceful, that I shall give you permission to fly with me to-morrow to the marshes.
joy	fairytale_sentences	You must strut about proudly- it will look well and make you respected."
anger	fairytale_sentences	"But may we not punish those naughty boys?" asked the young storks.
anger	fairytale_sentences	"We will revenge ourselves," whispered the young storks to each other, as they again joined the exercising.
anger	fairytale_sentences	The young storks were very angry, and grew worse as they grew older; so at last their mother was obliged to promise that they should be revenged, but not until the day of their departure.
joy	fairytale_sentences	"Yes, certainly," cried the mother stork.
joy	fairytale_sentences	"I have thought upon the best way to be revenged.
anger	fairytale_sentences	"But the naughty boy, who began the song first, what shall we do to him?" cried the young storks.
sadness	fairytale_sentences	"We will take it to the naughty boy, and he will cry because we have brought him a little dead brother.
joy	fairytale_sentences	This person, moreover, maintained that he belonged to a very old family in the land of Egypt, and that he was highly esteemed there.
joy	fairytale_sentences	"I sing so," he said, "that sixteen native crickets who have chirped from their youth up, and have never yet had a card house of their own, would become thinner than they are with envy if they were to hear me."
surprise	fairytale_sentences	That was very mean.
anger	fairytale_sentences	The Grasshopper only sprang half as high, but he sprang straight into the King's face, and the King declared that was horribly rude.
fear	fairytale_sentences	"I only hope he's not become unwell," said the Yard Dog, and then he smelt at him again.
anger	fairytale_sentences	"I jumped highest, after all," said the Flea.
disgust	fairytale_sentences	Let her have the goose-bone with its lump of wax and bit of stick.
anger	fairytale_sentences	I jumped to the highest; but in this world a body is required if one wishes to be seen."
anger	fairytale_sentences	And he too said, "Body is required! body is required!"
sadness	fairytale_sentences	And then he sang his own melancholy song, and from that we have gathered this story, which they say is not true, though it's in print.
sadness	fairytale_sentences	In this snug retreat sat a duck on her nest, watching for her young brood to hatch; she was beginning to get tired of her task, for the little ones were a long time coming out of their shells, and she seldom had any visitors.
joy	fairytale_sentences	"How large the world is," said the young ducks, when they found how much more room they now had than while they were inside the egg-shell.
sadness	fairytale_sentences	I wonder how long this is to last, I am quite tired of it;" and she seated herself again on the nest.
anger	fairytale_sentences	"One egg is not hatched yet," said the duck, "it will not break.
joy	fairytale_sentences	But just look at all the others, are they not the prettiest little ducklings you ever saw?
surprise	fairytale_sentences	It was very large and ugly.
surprise	fairytale_sentences	The duck stared at it and exclaimed, "It is very large and not at all like the others.
surprise	fairytale_sentences	"Oh," said the mother, "that is not a turkey; how well he uses his legs, and how upright he holds himself!
sadness	fairytale_sentences	"See, children, that is the way of the world," said the mother duck, whetting her beak, for she would have liked the eel's head herself.
anger	fairytale_sentences	The ducklings did as they were bid, but the other duck stared, and said, "Look, here comes another brood, as if there were not enough of us already! and what a queer looking object one of them is; we don't want him here," and then one flew out and bit him in the neck.
disgust	fairytale_sentences	"Yes, but he is so big and ugly," said the spiteful duck "and therefore he must be turned out."
disgust	fairytale_sentences	"The others are very pretty children," said the old duck, with the rag on her leg, "all but that one; I wish his mother could improve him a little."
disgust	fairytale_sentences	"That is impossible, your grace," replied the mother; "he is not pretty; but he has a very good disposition, and swims as well or even better than the others.
sadness	fairytale_sentences	"He is too big," they all said, and the turkey cock, who had been born into the world with spurs, and fancied himself really an emperor, puffed himself out like a vessel in full sail, and flew at the duckling, and became quite red in the head with passion, so that the poor little thing did not know where to go, and was quite miserable because he was so ugly and laughed at by the whole farmyard.
disgust	fairytale_sentences	The poor duckling was driven about by every one; even his brothers and sisters were unkind to him, and would say, "Ah, you ugly creature, I wish the cat would get you," and his mother said she wished he had never been born.
sadness	fairytale_sentences	"They are afraid of me because I am ugly," he said.
sadness	fairytale_sentences	Here he remained the whole night, feeling very tired and sorrowful.
surprise	fairytale_sentences	"You are exceedingly ugly," said the wild ducks, "but that will not matter if you do not want to marry one of our family."
joy	fairytale_sentences	After he had been on the moor two days, there came two wild geese, or rather goslings, for they had not been out of the egg long, and were very saucy.
joy	fairytale_sentences	"Listen, friend," said one of them to the duckling, "you are so ugly, that we like you very well.
surprise	fairytale_sentences	"Pop, pop," sounded in the air, and the two wild geese fell dead among the rushes, and the water was tinged with blood.
fear	fairytale_sentences	How they terrified the poor duckling!
joy	fairytale_sentences	He thrust his nose close to the duckling, showing his sharp teeth, and then, "splash, splash," he went into the water without touching him, "Oh," sighed the duckling, "how thankful I am for being so ugly; even a dog will not bite me."
fear	fairytale_sentences	It was late in the day before all became quiet, but even then the poor young thing did not dare to move.
joy	fairytale_sentences	She laid good eggs, and her mistress loved her as if she had been her own child.
surprise	fairytale_sentences	"Oh what a prize!" she exclaimed, "I hope it is not a drake, for then I shall have some duck's eggs.
disgust	fairytale_sentences	"Then you have no right to express an opinion when sensible people are speaking."
sadness	fairytale_sentences	So the duckling sat in a corner, feeling very low spirited, till the sunshine and the fresh air came into the room through the open door, and then he began to feel such a great longing for a swim on the water, that he could not help telling the hen.
disgust	fairytale_sentences	"What an absurd idea," said the hen.
disgust	fairytale_sentences	"You have nothing else to do, therefore you have foolish fancies.
joy	fairytale_sentences	"But it is so delightful to swim about on the water," said the duckling, "and so refreshing to feel it close over your head, while you dive down to the bottom."
disgust	fairytale_sentences	"Delightful, indeed!" said the hen, "why you must be crazy!
disgust	fairytale_sentences	Don't imagine such nonsense, child, and thank your good fortune that you have been received here.
disgust	fairytale_sentences	But you are a chatterer, and your company is not very agreeable.
sadness	fairytale_sentences	All this was very sad for the poor little duckling.
surprise	fairytale_sentences	The duckling had never seen any like them before.
surprise	fairytale_sentences	As they mounted higher and higher in the air, the ugly little duckling felt quite a strange sensation as he watched them.
fear	fairytale_sentences	He whirled himself in the water like a wheel, stretched out his neck towards them, and uttered a cry so strange that it frightened himself.
joy	fairytale_sentences	Could he ever forget those beautiful, happy birds; and when at last they were out of his sight, he dived under the water, and rose again almost beside himself with excitement.
fear	fairytale_sentences	The warmth revived the poor little creature; but when the children wanted to play with him, the duckling thought they would do him some harm; so he started up in terror, fluttered into the milk-pan, and splashed the milk about the room.
fear	fairytale_sentences	Then the woman clapped her hands, which frightened him still more.
sadness	fairytale_sentences	The door stood open; the poor creature could just manage to slip out among the bushes, and lie down quite exhausted in the newly fallen snow.
sadness	fairytale_sentences	It would be very sad, were I to relate all the misery and privations which the poor little duckling endured during the hard winter; but when it had passed, he found himself lying one morning in a moor, amongst the rushes.
sadness	fairytale_sentences	The duckling remembered the lovely birds, and felt more strangely unhappy than ever.
sadness	fairytale_sentences	"I will fly to those royal birds," he exclaimed, "and they will kill me, because I am so ugly, and dare to approach them; but it does not matter: better be killed by them than pecked by the ducks, beaten by the hens, pushed about by the maiden who feeds the poultry, or starved with hunger in the winter."
joy	fairytale_sentences	The moment they espied the stranger, they rushed to meet him with outstretched wings.
sadness	fairytale_sentences	"Kill me," said the poor bird; and he bent his head down to the surface of the water, and awaited death.
surprise	fairytale_sentences	His own image; no longer a dark, gray bird, ugly and disagreeable to look at, but a graceful and beautiful swan.
joy	fairytale_sentences	He now felt glad at having suffered sorrow and trouble, because it enabled him to enjoy so much better all the pleasure and happiness around him; for the great swans swam round the new-comer, and stroked his neck with their beaks, as a welcome.
joy	fairytale_sentences	"See," cried the youngest, "there is a new one;" and the rest were delighted, and ran to their father and mother, dancing and clapping their hands, and shouting joyously, "There is another swan come; a new one has arrived."
joy	fairytale_sentences	Then they threw more bread and cake into the water, and said, "The new one is the most beautiful of all; he is so young and pretty."
joy	fairytale_sentences	Then he rustled his feathers, curved his slender neck, and cried joyfully, from the depths of his heart, "I never dreamed of such happiness as this, while I was an ugly duckling."
disgust	fairytale_sentences	"Your 'something' is not enough for me," said the second brother; "what you talk of doing is nothing at all, it is journeyman's work, or might even be done by a machine.
disgust	fairytale_sentences	No!
disgust	fairytale_sentences	"I call it all nothing," said the third; "not in reality any position.
disgust	fairytale_sentences	"Not in my opinion," said the fourth; "I will never follow the lead of others, and only imitate what they have done.
surprise	fairytale_sentences	People said of this fifth brother, "There is something very precise about him; he has a good head-piece, but he does nothing."
surprise	fairytale_sentences	The eldest brother, he who fabricated bricks, soon discovered that each brick, when finished, brought him in a small coin, if only a copper one; and many copper pieces, if placed one upon another, can be changed into a shining shilling; and at whatever door a person knocks, who has a number of these in his hands, whether it be the baker's, the butcher's, or the tailor's, the door flies open, and he can get all he wants.
joy	fairytale_sentences	"While young, I can wander without a care, And build new houses everywhere; Fair and bright are my dreams of home, Always thought of wherever I roam.
joy	fairytale_sentences	Hurrah for a workman's life of glee!
joy	fairytale_sentences	It was really a pretty house, and in it were a happy pair.
joy	fairytale_sentences	The flag of the corporation fluttered before it, and the journeymen and apprentices shouted "Hurrah."
disgust	fairytale_sentences	"It is evidently for the sake of contrast that I and this wretched soul should arrive here exactly at the same time," said the critic.
anger	fairytale_sentences	"In what manner did you leave the world?" he asked, just for the sake of saying something; for it made him feel very weary to stand there and wait.
surprise	fairytale_sentences	"How I left the world?" she replied; "why, I can scarcely tell you.
fear	fairytale_sentences	I lay looking at the cloud till I observed a little black spot in the middle of it, which gradually grew larger and larger, and then I knew what it meant- I am old and experienced; and although this token is not often seen, I knew it, and a shuddering seized me.
joy	fairytale_sentences	Twice in my life had I seen this same thing, and I knew that there would be an awful storm, with a spring tide, which would overwhelm the poor people who were now out on the ice, drinking, dancing, and making merry.
fear	fairytale_sentences	I was so alarmed, that I felt more strength and life than I had done for some time.
joy	fairytale_sentences	I saw the people outside running and jumping about on the ice; I saw the beautiful flags waving in the wind; I heard the boys shouting, 'Hurrah!' and the lads and lasses singing, and everything full of merriment and joy.
fear	fairytale_sentences	I cried out as loudly as I could, but no one heard me; I was too far off from the people.
fear	fairytale_sentences	Soon would the storm burst, the ice break, and all who were on it be irretrievably lost.
sadness	fairytale_sentences	They could not hear me, and to go to them was quite out of my power.
sadness	fairytale_sentences	Oh, if I could only get them safe on land!
sadness	fairytale_sentences	I escaped fortunately as far as the threshold of the door; but there I fell down and remained: I could go no farther.
sadness	fairytale_sentences	The flames rushed out towards me, flickered on the window, and rose high above the roof.
fear	fairytale_sentences	The people on the ice became aware of the fire, and ran as fast as possible to help a poor sick woman, who, as they thought, was being burnt to death.
joy	fairytale_sentences	But the people had reached the sea-wall, where the sparks were flying round.
joy	fairytale_sentences	I had saved them all; but I suppose I could not survive the cold and fright; so I came up here to the gates of paradise.
joy	fairytale_sentences	"See," said the angel, pointing to the wonderful straw, "this is what the poor woman has brought.
disgust	fairytale_sentences	I know thou hast accomplished nothing, not even made a single brick.
disgust	fairytale_sentences	But thou canst not return to earth, and I can do nothing for thee."
fear	fairytale_sentences	She said, "His brother made all the stone and bricks, and sent them to me to build my poor little dwelling, which was a great deal to do for a poor woman like me.
fear	fairytale_sentences	Could not all these bricks and pieces be as a wall of stone to prevail for him?
sadness	fairytale_sentences	It was the hour of the mother's sorrow, when there pealed forth from the church tower the sound of festive bells.
joy	fairytale_sentences	In that solemn hour the sweet and joyous chiming filled the hearts of those in the humble dwelling with thankfulness and trust; and when, amidst these joyous sounds, a little son was born to them, the words of prayer and praise arose from their overflowing hearts, and their happiness seemed to ring out over town and country in the liquid tones of the church bells' chime.
joy	fairytale_sentences	The little one, with its bright eyes and golden hair, had been welcomed joyously on that dark November day.
joy	fairytale_sentences	Its parents kissed it lovingly, and the father wrote these words in the Bible, "On the tenth of November, 1759, God sent us a son."
sadness	fairytale_sentences	He and his sister, two years older than himself, had often wept scalding tears over the story of Him who suffered death on the cross for us all.
joy	fairytale_sentences	His mother also told him how the chiming of that old bell had once filled her heart with joy and confidence, and that in the midst of the sweet tones her child had been given to her.
joy	fairytale_sentences	He bowed his head over it and kissed it, old, thrown away, and cracked as it was, and standing there amidst the grass and nettles.
sadness	fairytale_sentences	A record of this bright display will live in the memory of man, for through it the pupil in the military school was in tears and sorrow.
sadness	fairytale_sentences	Dark days and cold nights also passed over the old bell, and it noticed them not; but the bell in the man's heart felt it to be a gloomy time.
joy	fairytale_sentences	An old maid stood at the window; she had hung chickweed over the cage, and the little linnet which it contained hopped from perch to perch and sang and twittered merrily.
joy	fairytale_sentences	"Yes, it's all very well for you to sing," said the bottle neck: that is, he did not really speak the words as we do, for the neck of a bottle cannot speak; but he thought them to himself in his own mind, just as people sometimes talk quietly to themselves.
disgust	fairytale_sentences	"Yes, you may sing very well, you have all your limbs uninjured; you should feel what it is like to lose your body, and only have a neck and a mouth left, with a cork stuck in it, as I have: you wouldn't sing then, I know.
sadness	fairytale_sentences	I have no reason to sing, nor could I sing now if I were ever so happy; but when I was a whole bottle, and they rubbed me with a cork, didn't I sing then?
joy	fairytale_sentences	The little bird sang his own song merrily; in the street below there was driving and running to and fro, every one thought of his own affairs, or perhaps of nothing at all; but the bottle neck thought deeply.
surprise	fairytale_sentences	The bottle did not behold the light of day again, until it was unpacked with the rest in the wine merchant's cellar, and, for the first time, rinsed with water, which caused some very curious sensations.
joy	fairytale_sentences	"Ah, how beautiful is life."
joy	fairytale_sentences	All these tones of joy and song in the bottle were like the working of a young poet's brain, who often knows not the meaning of the tones which are sounding within him.
joy	fairytale_sentences	She was young and pretty; her brown eyes laughed, and a smile lingered round her mouth as sweet as that in her eyes.
sadness	fairytale_sentences	There had been a great deal of talk on this subject while the basket was being packed, and during this conversation the eyes and the mouth of the furrier's daughter did not wear a very joyful expression.
joy	fairytale_sentences	It remained there a long time; but when at last it was brought forth it appeared as if something pleasant had happened, for every one was laughing; the furrier's daughter laughed too, but she said very little, and her cheeks were like two roses.
surprise	fairytale_sentences	What a strange sensation it was to have the cork drawn for the first time!
joy	fairytale_sentences	"Long life to the betrothed," cried the papa, and every glass was emptied to the dregs, while the young sailor kissed his beautiful bride.
joy	fairytale_sentences	"Happiness and blessing to you both," said the old people-father and mother, and the young man filled the glasses again.
joy	fairytale_sentences	"Safe return, and a wedding this day next year," he cried; and when the glasses were empty he took the bottle, raised it on high, and said, "Thou hast been present here on the happiest day of my life; thou shalt never be used by others!"
disgust	fairytale_sentences	"I gave them wine, and they gave me muddy water," he had said to himself, "but I suppose it was all well meant."
joy	fairytale_sentences	He could no longer see the betrothed couple, nor the cheerful old people; but for a long time he could hear them rejoicing and singing.
joy	fairytale_sentences	Those were happy days, and the bottle would sing when rubbed with a cork, and it was called a great lark," "Peter Jensen's lark."
sadness	fairytale_sentences	At the last moment, when the ship was sinking, the young mate wrote on a piece of paper, "We are going down: God's will be done."
surprise	fairytale_sentences	"What trouble they have taken with that bottle over yonder!" said one, and very likely it is broken after all."
surprise	fairytale_sentences	But the bottle was not broken, and, better still, it understood every word that was said: this language it had heard at the furnaces and at the wine merchant's; in the forest and on the ship,- it was the only good old language it could understand.
joy	fairytale_sentences	It had returned home, and the language was as a welcome greeting.
joy	fairytale_sentences	For very joy, it felt ready to jump out of people's hands, and scarcely noticed that its cork had been drawn, and its contents emptied out, till it found itself carried to a cellar, to be left there and forgotten.
joy	fairytale_sentences	"There's no place like home, even if it's a cellar."
joy	fairytale_sentences	It never occurred to him to think that he might lie there for years, he felt so comfortable.
joy	fairytale_sentences	The stars twinkled; and the new moon, in the form of a crescent, was surrounded by the shadowy disc of the whole moon, and looked like a gray globe with a golden rim: it was a beautiful sight for those who had good eyes.
joy	fairytale_sentences	Everything here appeared lovely to our bottle, for it was again in the green wood, amid joy and feasting; again it heard music and song, and the noise and murmur of a crowd, especially in that part of the garden where the lamps blazed, and the paper lanterns displayed their brilliant colors.
joy	fairytale_sentences	It stood in a distant walk certainly, but a place pleasant for contemplation; and it carried a light; and was at once useful and ornamental.
joy	fairytale_sentences	It seemed to the bottle as if he were living that time over again.
joy	fairytale_sentences	Not only the guests but other people were walking in the garden, who were allowed to witness the splendor and the festivities.
joy	fairytale_sentences	She was thinking, like the bottle, of the green wood, and of a young betrothed pair, who were closely connected with herself; she was thinking of that hour, the happiest of her life, in which she had taken part, when she had herself been one of that betrothed pair; such hours are never to be forgotten, let a maiden be as old as she may.
joy	fairytale_sentences	The rabbit was quite excited because he knew that he was to be taken up, and let down again in a parachute.
joy	fairytale_sentences	Then the ropes which held it were cut through, and the aerial ship rose in the air with the aeronaut and the basket containing the bottle and the rabbit, while the music sounded and all the people shouted "Hurrah."
joy	fairytale_sentences	"This is a wonderful journey up into the air," thought the bottle; "it is a new way of sailing, and here, at least, there is no fear of striking against anything."
surprise	fairytale_sentences	Then it began to descend much more rapidly than the rabbit had done, made somersaults in the air, and felt itself quite young and unfettered, although it was half full of wine.
joy	fairytale_sentences	Then they hung it in the cage of the little bird, who sang and twittered more merrily than ever.
joy	fairytale_sentences	Do you see how splendidly the tree has grown?
sadness	fairytale_sentences	It has been raised from only a little sprig of myrtle that you gave me on the day after my betrothal, and from which I was to make my own bridal bouquet when a year had passed: but that day never came; the eyes were closed which were to have been my light and joy through life.
joy	fairytale_sentences	Before the sprig you gave me faded, I took a spray, and planted it in the earth; and now, as you see, it has become a large tree, and a bunch of the blossoms shall at last appear at a wedding festival, in the bouquet of your daughter."
joy	fairytale_sentences	At the window of one of them sat a little boy with fresh rosy cheeks, and clear sparkling eyes, who was very fond of the old house, in sunshine or in moonlight.
joy	fairytale_sentences	Certainly it was a very good house to look at for amusement.
sadness	fairytale_sentences	The little boy one day heard his parents say, "The old man opposite is very well off, but is terribly lonely."
joy	fairytale_sentences	And the old attendant nodded and looked very pleased, and then he carried the tin soldier into the house.
disgust	fairytale_sentences	Oh dear, how I am creaking.
disgust	fairytale_sentences	Gout in my back, ugh."
joy	fairytale_sentences	"Thank you for the tin soldier my little friend," said the old man, "and thank you also for coming to see me."
joy	fairytale_sentences	"Thanks, thanks," or "Creak, creak," said all the furniture.
joy	fairytale_sentences	"Oh," replied the old man, "I have pleasant thoughts of all that has passed, recalled by memory; and now you are come to visit me, and that is very pleasant."
joy	fairytale_sentences	It was very pleasant, certainly, to be in that old house.
sadness	fairytale_sentences	"I cannot endure it," said the tin soldier, who stood on a shelf, "it is so lonely and dull here.
sadness	fairytale_sentences	I have been accustomed to live in a family, and I cannot get used to this life.
sadness	fairytale_sentences	I cannot bear it.
joy	fairytale_sentences	It is not here like it was in your house opposite, when your father and mother talked so cheerfully together, while you and all the dear children made such a delightful noise.
sadness	fairytale_sentences	No, it is all lonely in the old man's house.
sadness	fairytale_sentences	Oh, I cannot bear it."
sadness	fairytale_sentences	"Ah, but I never see any, and I don't know them," said the tin soldier, "and I cannot bear it."
joy	fairytale_sentences	Then the old man came back with a pleasant face; and brought with him beautiful preserved fruits, as well as apples and nuts; and the little boy thought no more of the tin soldier.
joy	fairytale_sentences	How happy and delighted the little boy was; and after he returned home, and while days and weeks passed, a great deal of nodding took place from one house to the other, and then the little boy went to pay another visit.
sadness	fairytale_sentences	"I cannot bear it any longer," said the tin soldier; "I have wept tears of tin, it is so melancholy here.
sadness	fairytale_sentences	Let me go to the wars, and lose an arm or a leg, that would be some change; I cannot bear it.
sadness	fairytale_sentences	I have had visits from mine, and you may believe me it is not altogether pleasant.
joy	fairytale_sentences	You all stood looking very grave, although it was very difficult to do so, but I laughed so to myself that I fell down from the table, and got a bruise, which is there still; I know it was not right to laugh.
sadness	fairytale_sentences	Ah, really he must be very happy; I cannot endure this life."
joy	fairytale_sentences	Then he looked at the picture he had bought at the broker's, and his eyes sparkled brightly as he nodded at it, and said, "Ah, she could sing that tune."
sadness	fairytale_sentences	"I will go to the wars!
sadness	fairytale_sentences	I will go to the wars!" cried the tin soldier as loud as he could, and threw himself down on the floor.
surprise	fairytale_sentences	And indeed nobody was home, for the old man was dead.
sadness	fairytale_sentences	He was to be taken to the country to be buried there in his own grave; so they carried him away; no one followed him, for all his friends were dead; and the little boy kissed his hand to the coffin as the hearse moved away with it.
joy	fairytale_sentences	The sparrows assembled in dozens upon the wild vines, and chattered all together as loud as they could, but not about the old house; none of them could remember it, for many years had passed by, so many indeed, that the little boy was now a man, and a really good man too, and his parents were very proud of him.
joy	fairytale_sentences	He was just married, and had come, with his young wife, to reside in the new house with the garden in front of it, and now he stood there by her side while she planted a field flower that she thought very pretty.
surprise	fairytale_sentences	"Oh dear, what was that?" she exclaimed, as something pricked her.
surprise	fairytale_sentences	It was- only think!- it was really the tin soldier, the very same which had been lost up in the old man's room, and had been hidden among old wood and rubbish for a long time, till it sunk into the earth, where it must have been for many years.
joy	fairytale_sentences	And the tin soldier felt as if he was recovering from a fainting fit.
joy	fairytale_sentences	"Let me see him," said the young man, and then he smiled and shook his head, and said, "It can scarcely be the same, but it reminds me of something that happened to one of my tin soldiers when I was a little boy."
sadness	fairytale_sentences	"Oh, how dreadfully lonely he must have been," said she.
joy	fairytale_sentences	"Yes, terribly lonely," cried the tin soldier; "still it is delightful not to be forgotten."
joy	fairytale_sentences	The emperor ordered them to be carried into the great hall where the princess was just playing "Visitors are coming" with her ladies-in-waiting; when she saw the large cases with the presents therein, she clapped her hands for joy.
joy	fairytale_sentences	"Oh, how nicely it is made," exclaimed the ladies.
joy	fairytale_sentences	"It is more than nice," said the emperor, "it is charming."
surprise	fairytale_sentences	"For shame, pa," she said, "it is not artificial, it is natural!"
disgust	fairytale_sentences	"For shame, it is natural" repeated all her ladies.
joy	fairytale_sentences	"Superbe, charmant," said the ladies of the court, for they all prattled French, one worse than the other.
sadness	fairytale_sentences	"You are right," said the emperor, and began to cry like a little child.
joy	fairytale_sentences	But the prince was not discouraged.
joy	fairytale_sentences	When the princess with her ladies passed by and heard the tune, she stopped and looked quite pleased, for she also could play it- in fact, it was the only tune she could play, and she played it with one finger.
joy	fairytale_sentences	"That is the tune I know," she exclaimed.
disgust	fairytale_sentences	"God forbid," said the lady.
disgust	fairytale_sentences	"It is very naughty," said the princess, and walked off.
disgust	fairytale_sentences	"That is tiresome," said the princess.
joy	fairytale_sentences	That was a pleasure!
joy	fairytale_sentences	The ladies danced and clapped their hands for joy.
joy	fairytale_sentences	"But that is superbe," said the princess passing by.
joy	fairytale_sentences	"I have never heard a more beautiful composition.
disgust	fairytale_sentences	"I believe he is mad," said the princess, and walked off, but soon she stopped.
disgust	fairytale_sentences	"But we do not like to kiss him" said the ladies.
disgust	fairytale_sentences	"The ladies of the court are up to some mischief, I think.
surprise	fairytale_sentences	"What does this mean?" he said, when he saw that his daughter was kissing the swineherd, and then hit their heads with his shoe just as the swineherd received the sixty-eighth kiss.
anger	fairytale_sentences	"Go out of my sight," said the emperor, for he was very angry; and both the princess and the swineherd were banished from the empire.
sadness	fairytale_sentences	There she stood and cried, the swineherd scolded her, and the rain came down in torrents.
sadness	fairytale_sentences	"Alas, unfortunate creature that I am!" said the princess, "I wish I had accepted the prince.
sadness	fairytale_sentences	Oh, how wretched I am!"
anger	fairytale_sentences	"I have now learnt to despise you," he said.
disgust	fairytale_sentences	"You refused an honest prince; you did not appreciate the rose and the nightingale; but you did not mind kissing a swineherd for his toys; you have no one but yourself to blame!"
joy	fairytale_sentences	And then she can tell the most wonderful stories.
joy	fairytale_sentences	She has a hymn-book with large silver clasps, in which she often reads; and in the book, between the leaves, lies a rose, quite flat and dry; it is not so pretty as the roses which are standing in the glass, and yet she smiles at it most pleasantly, and tears even come into her eyes.
joy	fairytale_sentences	Why, when grandmother's tears fall upon the rose, and she is looking at it, the rose revives, and fills the room with its fragrance; the walls vanish as in a mist, and all around her is the glorious green wood, where in summer the sunlight streams through thick foliage; and grandmother, why she is young again, a charming maiden, fresh as a rose, with round, rosy cheeks, fair, bright ringlets, and a figure pretty and graceful; but the eyes, those mild, saintly eyes, are the same,- they have been left to grandmother.
joy	fairytale_sentences	At her side sits a young man, tall and strong; he gives her a rose and she smiles.
sadness	fairytale_sentences	Grandmother cannot smile like that now.
joy	fairytale_sentences	We could hear her gentle breathing as she slept; gradually it became quieter and calmer, and on her countenance beamed happiness and peace.
joy	fairytale_sentences	It was as if lighted up with a ray of sunshine.
joy	fairytale_sentences	She smiled once more, and then people said she was dead.
joy	fairytale_sentences	She was laid in a black coffin, looking mild and beautiful in the white folds of the shrouded linen, though her eyes were closed; but every wrinkle had vanished, her hair looked white and silvery, and around her mouth lingered a sweet smile.
joy	fairytale_sentences	They are better off than we are; the dead return no more.
joy	fairytale_sentences	But over the grave fresh roses bloom, the nightingale sings, and the organ sounds and there still lives a remembrance of old grandmother, with the loving, gentle eyes that always looked young.
surprise	fairytale_sentences	It is quite a picture to see a half-naked boy clasping the well-formed creature by the head, as he presses his rosy lips against its jaws.
sadness	fairytale_sentences	In the garden of the grand duke's palace, under the roof of one of the wings, where a thousand roses bloom in winter, a little ragged boy had been sitting the whole day long; a boy, who might serve as a type of Italy, lovely and smiling, and yet still suffering.
sadness	fairytale_sentences	He was hungry and thirsty, yet no one gave him anything; and when it became dark, and they were about to close the gardens, the porter turned him out.
surprise	fairytale_sentences	The Metal Pig raised himself gently, and the boy heard him say quite distinctly, "Hold tight, little boy, for I am going to run;" and away he started for a most wonderful ride.
fear	fairytale_sentences	The metallic groups of figures, among which were Perseus and the Rape of the Sabines, looked like living persons, and cries of terror sounded from them all across the noble square.
joy	fairytale_sentences	The little boy said not a word; he was half pleased and half afraid.
joy	fairytale_sentences	But the grandest appeared when the door of a side room opened; the little boy could remember what beautiful things he had seen there, but to-night everything shone in its brightest colors.
joy	fairytale_sentences	As they passed from hall to hall, beauty everywhere showed itself; and as the Metal Pig went step by step from one picture to the other, the little boy could see it all plainly.
joy	fairytale_sentences	One glory eclipsed another; yet there was one picture that fixed itself on the little boy's memory, more especially because of the happy children it represented, for these the little boy had seen in daylight.
joy	fairytale_sentences	The Florentine, Angiolo Bronzino, painted this picture; most beautiful is the expression on the face of the two children, who appear to have full confidence that they shall reach heaven at last.
joy	fairytale_sentences	They are embracing each other, and one little one stretches out his hand towards another who stands below him, and points to himself, as if he were saying, "I am going to heaven."
joy	fairytale_sentences	The older people stand as if uncertain, yet hopeful, and they bow in humble adoration to the Lord Jesus.
joy	fairytale_sentences	The boy raised his hands towards the smiling children, and then the Pig ran off with him through the open vestibule.
joy	fairytale_sentences	"Thank you, thank you, you beautiful animal," said the little boy, caressing the Metal Pig as it ran down the steps.
joy	fairytale_sentences	"Thanks to yourself also," replied the Metal Pig; "I have helped you and you have helped me, for it is only when I have an innocent child on my back that I receive the power to run.
sadness	fairytale_sentences	Yes; as you see, I can even venture under the rays of the lamp, in front of the picture of the Madonna, but I may not enter the church; still from without, and while you are upon my back, I may look in through the open door.
fear	fairytale_sentences	Do not get down yet, for if you do, then I shall be lifeless, as you have seen me in the Porta Rosa."
joy	fairytale_sentences	"I will stay with you, my dear creature," said the little boy.
surprise	fairytale_sentences	The boy stretched forth his hands towards the light, and at the same moment the Metal Pig started again so rapidly that he was obliged to cling tightly to him.
surprise	fairytale_sentences	The wind whistled in his ears, he heard the church door creak on its hinges as it closed, and it seemed to him as if he had lost his senses- then a cold shudder passed over him, and he awoke.
fear	fairytale_sentences	Fear and trembling came upon him as he thought of his mother; she had sent him out the day before to get some money, he had not done so, and now he was hungry and thirsty.
sadness	fairytale_sentences	Once more he clasped the neck of his metal horse, kissed its nose, and nodded farewell to it.
surprise	fairytale_sentences	Another broken-down staircase led from the gallery, and two Russian sailors running down it almost upset the poor boy.
fear	fairytale_sentences	"Don't be angry," he pleaded; "I received nothing, I have nothing at all;" and he seized his mother's dress and would have kissed it.
surprise	fairytale_sentences	This pot she took in her lap, warmed her fingers, and pushed the boy with her elbow.
anger	fairytale_sentences	"Certainly you must have some money," she said.
sadness	fairytale_sentences	The boy began to cry, and then she struck him with her foot till he cried out louder.
disgust	fairytale_sentences	"Felicita," she said, "what are you doing to the child?"
anger	fairytale_sentences	"The child is mine," she answered; "I can murder him if I like, and you too, Giannina."
anger	fairytale_sentences	And then she swung about the fire-pot.
fear	fairytale_sentences	The boy rushed out at the sight, sped across the courtyard, and fled from the house.
sadness	fairytale_sentences	Here everything was bright, and the boy knelt down by the first tomb on his right, the grave of Michael Angelo, and sobbed as if his heart would break.
sadness	fairytale_sentences	Hunger and thirst overpowered the child, and he became quite faint and ill.
joy	fairytale_sentences	A little white poodle, so closely shaven that his pink skin could plainly be seen, frisked about the room, and gambolled upon the boy.
joy	fairytale_sentences	"Innocent souls are soon intimate," said the woman, as she caressed both the boy and the dog.
joy	fairytale_sentences	These good people gave the child food and drink, and said he should stay with them all night, and that the next day the old man, who was called Giuseppe, would go and speak to his mother.
joy	fairytale_sentences	A little homely bed was prepared for him, but to him who had so often slept on the hard stones it was a royal couch, and he slept sweetly and dreamed of the splendid pictures and of the Metal Pig.
sadness	fairytale_sentences	He wept at the thought, and then he played with the little, lively dog, and kissed it, while the old woman looked kindly at him to encourage him.
joy	fairytale_sentences	Then she said, "He is a good lad, he shall stay with us, he may become a clever glovemaker, like you.
joy	fairytale_sentences	So the boy stayed with them, and the woman herself taught him to sew; and he ate well, and slept well, and became very merry.
surprise	fairytale_sentences	Suddenly he fancied he heard feet outside going pit-a-pat.
sadness	fairytale_sentences	But there was nothing to be seen; whatever he had heard had passed already.
joy	fairytale_sentences	They stopped before the picture by Bronzino, in which Christ is represented as standing in the lower world, with the children smiling before Him, in the sweet expectation of entering heaven; and the poor boy smiled, too, for here was his heaven.
anger	fairytale_sentences	"Why don't you go?" said the painter.
joy	fairytale_sentences	"You happy creature," he said; "how I have longed for you! we must take a ride to-night."
surprise	fairytale_sentences	But the Metal Pig lay motionless, while the fresh stream gushed forth from its mouth.
surprise	fairytale_sentences	He looked down, and there was Bellissima, little smooth-shaven Bellissima, barking as if she would have said, "Here I am too; why are you sitting there?"
fear	fairytale_sentences	A fiery dragon could not have frightened the little boy so much as did the little dog in this place.
surprise	fairytale_sentences	"Bellissima in the street, and not dressed!" as the old lady called it; "what would be the end of this?"
sadness	fairytale_sentences	The poor little thing trembled so with cold, that the boy ran homeward as fast as he could.
surprise	fairytale_sentences	"Where have you stolen that pretty dog?" they asked; and they took it away from him.
fear	fairytale_sentences	The boy did not know whether he had better jump into the Arno, or go home and confess everything.
fear	fairytale_sentences	They would certainly kill him, he thought.
fear	fairytale_sentences	"Bellissima in the watch-house!" she cried.
anger	fairytale_sentences	"You bad boy! how did you entice her out?
fear	fairytale_sentences	Poor little delicate thing, with those rough policemen! and she'll be frozen with cold."
sadness	fairytale_sentences	Giuseppe went off at once, while his wife lamented, and the boy wept.
anger	fairytale_sentences	The painter, however, consoled the little fellow, and tried to soften the lady's anger; but she would not be pacified till her husband returned with Bellissima, who had been with the police.
joy	fairytale_sentences	Then there was great rejoicing, and the painter caressed the boy, and gave him a number of pictures.
joy	fairytale_sentences	Oh, what beautiful pictures these were!- figures with funny heads; and, above all, the Metal Pig was there too.
joy	fairytale_sentences	Oh, nothing could be more delightful.
joy	fairytale_sentences	The first leisure moment during the next day, the boy got a pencil, and on the back of one of the other drawings he attempted to copy the drawing of the Metal Pig, and he succeeded.
joy	fairytale_sentences	Certainly it was rather crooked, rather up and down, one leg thick, and another thin; still it was like the copy, and he was overjoyed at what he had done.
joy	fairytale_sentences	A second pig was drawn by the side of the first, and this looked a hundred times better; and the third attempt was so good, that everybody might know what it was meant to represent.
joy	fairytale_sentences	His collection of pictures increased; but as yet they were only copies of lifeless objects, when one day Bellissima came gambolling before him: "Stand still," cried he, "and I will draw you beautifully, to put amongst my collection."
anger	fairytale_sentences	He tied her head and tail; but she barked and jumped, and so pulled and tightened the string, that she was nearly strangled; and just then her mistress walked in.
anger	fairytale_sentences	"You wicked boy! the poor little creature!" was all she could utter.
anger	fairytale_sentences	She pushed the boy from her, thrust him away with her foot, called him a most ungrateful, good-for-nothing, wicked boy, and forbade him to enter the house again.
sadness	fairytale_sentences	A large gilt frame surrounded it, and on one corner of the frame a laurel wreath had been hung; but a black band, twined unseen among the green leaves, and a streamer of crape, hung down from it; for within the last few days the young artist had- died.
sadness	fairytale_sentences	Fortunately she scrambled out of the bucket; but she fell into the water with a terrible flop, and had to lie sick for three days with pains in her back.
disgust	fairytale_sentences	"She's thick, and fat and ugly," said the young green Frogs; "and her children will be just as ugly as she is."
disgust	fairytale_sentences	The young frogs listened and stared; and as these words did not please them, they made grimaces and dived down under the water.
joy	fairytale_sentences	"Oh, it is such a splendid and precious thing, that I cannot describe it," said the Mother-Toad.
disgust	fairytale_sentences	"Quack!" said the little Toad; and that's just as if one of us were to say, "Aha!"
disgust	fairytale_sentences	"You're the ugliest thing I've seen for one while."
joy	fairytale_sentences	"It's much nicer here than down in the well!
joy	fairytale_sentences	I should like to stay here my whole life long!" said the little Toad.
joy	fairytale_sentences	"It's almost too much of a good thing here; it tickles one so."
joy	fairytale_sentences	"It's a glorious thing to live! glorious to get out of the well, and to lie among the stinging-nettles, and to crawl along the dusty road.
joy	fairytale_sentences	"It will be too damp for you here," said the Frogs; "but you are very welcome!
joy	fairytale_sentences	But it doesn't matter; you are equally welcome."
anger	fairytale_sentences	I must get higher yet; I feel a great restlessness and longing."
surprise	fairytale_sentences	How great it is! how bright it is!
surprise	fairytale_sentences	Oh, how it seems to shine in my head!
joy	fairytale_sentences	But I haven't the jewel; not that I cry about that- no, I must go higher up, into splendor and joy!
fear	fairytale_sentences	I feel so confident, and yet I am afraid.
fear	fairytale_sentences	It's a difficult step to take, and yet it must be taken.
joy	fairytale_sentences	Onward, therefore, straight onward!"
surprise	fairytale_sentences	"What a number of different creatures there are that I never knew! and how beautiful and great the world is!
surprise	fairytale_sentences	"How green it is here! how beautiful it is here!"
disgust	fairytale_sentences	It hides half the world from me, but I don't care for the world."
disgust	fairytale_sentences	"It doesn't do that with a good will," thought the Fowl, and lifted up her head to peck at the Caterpillar.
fear	fairytale_sentences	The Toad was so horrified at this, that she came crawling straight up towards the Fowl.
surprise	fairytale_sentences	"Aha, it has allies," quoth the Fowl.
disgust	fairytale_sentences	"Just look at the crawling thing!"
disgust	fairytale_sentences	"I don't care for the little green morsel; it would only tickle my throat."
joy	fairytale_sentences	"I writhed myself free," said the Caterpillar.
joy	fairytale_sentences	"What a good thing it is when one has presence of mind!
sadness	fairytale_sentences	And the little Toad came up and expressed her sympathy.
joy	fairytale_sentences	She was glad that in her ugliness she had frightened the fowls.
joy	fairytale_sentences	Nothing is so beautiful as property.
joy	fairytale_sentences	"Yes, higher up," said the little Toad; "higher-up!
surprise	fairytale_sentences	"How high up they live!" thought the Toad.
surprise	fairytale_sentences	"If one could only get as high as that!"
joy	fairytale_sentences	"But it's so wonderfully ugly," persisted the first.
surprise	fairytale_sentences	"A jewel!" cried the naturalist.
joy	fairytale_sentences	"What a good thing that I have not got it!
disgust	fairytale_sentences	"Man is the most conceited creature!" said the Stork.
disgust	fairytale_sentences	"Listen how their jaws are wagging; and for all that they can't clap properly.
disgust	fairytale_sentences	They boast of their gifts of eloquence and their language!
disgust	fairytale_sentences	It makes my beak turn cold when I think of it.
disgust	fairytale_sentences	The world could get on without men.
surprise	fairytale_sentences	"What a great man that is yonder! and how high he sits!
surprise	fairytale_sentences	Higher than ever I saw any one sit yet; and how he can swim!" she cried, as the Stork soared away through the air with outspread pinions.
joy	fairytale_sentences	"I must go to Egypt!" said she.
joy	fairytale_sentences	"If the Stork or one of his young ones would only take me!
joy	fairytale_sentences	Yes, I shall get to Egypt, for I feel so happy!
joy	fairytale_sentences	All the longing and all the pleasure that I feel is much better than having a jewel in one's head."
joy	fairytale_sentences	The Stork's beak pinched her, and the wind whistled; it was not exactly agreeable, but she was going upward- upward towards Egypt- and she knew it; and that was why her eyes gleamed, and a spark seemed to fly out of them.
surprise	fairytale_sentences	"Quunk!- ah!"
joy	fairytale_sentences	WE are in a rich, happy house, where the master, the servants, the friends of the family are full of joy and felicity.
joy	fairytale_sentences	For on this day a son and heir has been born, and mother and child are doing well.
joy	fairytale_sentences	Everything invited to slumber, everything had a charming look of repose; and so the nurse had discovered, for she slept; and well she might sleep, while everything around her told of happiness and blessing.
joy	fairytale_sentences	"Everything has been bestowed here," said the guardian angel.
disgust	fairytale_sentences	"Wanting!" cried the guardian angel; "nothing must be wanting here; and if it is so, let us fetch it; let us seek the powerful fairy; let us go to her."
anger	fairytale_sentences	"Her pearl must not be missing; it must be there, that the crown, when worn, may be complete.
sadness	fairytale_sentences	Tears of sorrow rolled down their cheeks, and fell in heavy drops on the floor, but not a word was spoken.
sadness	fairytale_sentences	The silence which reigned here expressed a world of grief.
sadness	fairytale_sentences	With silent steps, still sobbing, they left the room.
sadness	fairytale_sentences	Strange men came in and placed the lid of the coffin over the dead, and drove the nails firmly in; while the blows of the hammer resounded through the house, and echoed in the hearts that were bleeding.
fear	fairytale_sentences	"Whither art thou leading me?" asked the guardian angel.
sadness	fairytale_sentences	A hot tear rolled into her lap, and formed itself into a pearl, glowing with all the colors of the rainbow.
joy	fairytale_sentences	At times the snow would be piled so high around our hut as almost to hide it, and then my mother appeared most cheerful.
joy	fairytale_sentences	She would hold my head between her hands, and sing the songs she never sang at other times, for the Turks, our masters, would not allow it.
disgust	fairytale_sentences	And the stag answered, 'The Turk has come to our city; he has wild dogs for the chase, a goodly pack.' 'I will drive them away across the islands!' cried the young roebuck; 'I will drive them away across the islands into the deep sea.'
sadness	fairytale_sentences	And when my mother sang thus, her eyes would become moist; and on the long eyelashes were tears, but she concealed them and watched the black bread baking in the ashes.
anger	fairytale_sentences	Then I would clench my fist, and cry, "We will kill these Turks!"
surprise	fairytale_sentences	Soon after, we heard the sound of firing.
sadness	fairytale_sentences	I saw my poor dead father, and cried till I fell asleep.
surprise	fairytale_sentences	When I awoke, I found myself in a prison; but the room was not worse than our own in the hut.
joy	fairytale_sentences	The music sounded, and the people left the church hand-in-hand, with joy and gladness.
surprise	fairytale_sentences	They were the same stars, and in the same position over me as when I used to sit in front of our hut at Delphi, and I had almost begun to fancy I was still there, when suddenly there was a splash in the water- Anastasia had fallen in; but in a moment Aphtanides has sprung in after her, and was now holding her up to me.
fear	fairytale_sentences	We dried her clothes as well as we were able, and remained on the water till they were dry; for we did not wish it to be known what a fright we had had, nor the danger which our little adopted sister had incurred, in whose life Aphtanides had now a part.
joy	fairytale_sentences	How peaceful and silent it was as we walked on through the thick, wild thyme, still fragrant, though the sun had scorched the leaves.
fear	fairytale_sentences	My mother lighted a fire, and roasted some roots she had brought with her, and I and my little sister slept among the bushes, without fear of the ugly smidraki, from whose throat issues fire, or of the wolf and the jackal; for my mother sat by us, and I considered her presence sufficient protection.
joy	fairytale_sentences	He said he had been longing to see us so much; and he remained with us two whole happy days.
surprise	fairytale_sentences	"How much you know!"
surprise	fairytale_sentences	I exclaimed, "and what wonders you can relate?"
joy	fairytale_sentences	"I think what you once told me, the finest of all," he replied; "you told me of a thing that has never been out of my thoughts- of the good old custom of 'the bond of friendship,'- a custom I should like to follow.
joy	fairytale_sentences	Brother, let you and I go to church, as your father and Anastasia's father once did.
joy	fairytale_sentences	Your sister Anastasia is the most beautiful and most innocent of maidens, and she shall consecrate the deed.
joy	fairytale_sentences	Anastasia blushed like a young rose, and my mother kissed Aphtanides.
joy	fairytale_sentences	Then she joined out hands and kissed us on the forehead, and we again prayed silently.
fear	fairytale_sentences	I saw it, I understood the cause, and I believe my hand trembled too.
sadness	fairytale_sentences	"And she shall be thine," he exclaimed; "thine!
sadness	fairytale_sentences	I also love her, but tomorrow I depart.
sadness	fairytale_sentences	She looked at Aphtanides with a sweet but mournful expression on her face.
sadness	fairytale_sentences	"To-morrow you are going to leave us," she said.
sadness	fairytale_sentences	"I am very sorry."
sadness	fairytale_sentences	"Sorry!" he exclaimed, and his voice was troubled with a grief as deep as my own.
joy	fairytale_sentences	I threw my arms round her, and pressed my lips to hers.
sadness	fairytale_sentences	Many of them were very aged; lonely old boys, with strange thoughts and eccentric habits.
fear	fairytale_sentences	If even a tiny spark had remained it might set fire to something, and cause great damage.
fear	fairytale_sentences	But often, when he had got half way back, he would fancy the iron shutters of the door were not properly fastened, and his thin legs would carry him down again.
sadness	fairytale_sentences	And when at last he crept into bed, he would be so cold that his teeth chattered in his head.
sadness	fairytale_sentences	But this was scarcely an agreeable entertainment; for thoughts of olden memories raise the curtains from the past, and sometimes pierce the heart with painful recollections till the agony brings tears to the waking eyes.
sadness	fairytale_sentences	And so it was with Anthony; often the scalding tears, like pearly drops, would fall from his eyes to the coverlet and roll on the floor with a sound as if one of his heartstrings had broken.
sadness	fairytale_sentences	If he dried his eyes with his nightcap, then the tear and the picture would be crushed; but the source of the tears remained and welled up again in his heart.
sadness	fairytale_sentences	The pictures did not follow one another in order, as the circumstances they represented had occurred; very often the most painful would come together, and when those came which were most full of joy, they had always the deepest shadow thrown upon them.
sadness	fairytale_sentences	How vividly were represented to him, in a glittering tear that rolled down his cheek, two children at play- a boy and a girl.
joy	fairytale_sentences	Then they got a flower-pot, filled it with earth, and were soon both very busy and eager about it.
joy	fairytale_sentences	"They are Molly and me," said the boy.
joy	fairytale_sentences	"How wonderful they are, and so beautiful!"
sadness	fairytale_sentences	And all this about the two children was mirrored to old Anthony in a single tear, which could soon be wiped away and disappear, but might come again from its source in the heart of the old man.
joy	fairytale_sentences	"I may kiss him," she would say proudly, as she threw her arms round his neck; she was vain of her power over Anthony, for he would submit quietly and think nothing of it.
sadness	fairytale_sentences	And Molly and Anthony both wept, but these tears all flowed together into one tear which had the rosy shimmer of joy.
joy	fairytale_sentences	Molly had told him that she loved him- loved him more than all the splendors of Weimar.
sadness	fairytale_sentences	One, two, three years went by, and during the whole time he received only two letters.
joy	fairytale_sentences	One stanza pleased him exceedingly-
joy	fairytale_sentences	"Through the forest, and in the vale, Sweetly warbles the nightingale.
joy	fairytale_sentences	He was received with a hearty welcome, and introduced to plenty of grand and pleasant company, where overflowing winecups were passed about.
sadness	fairytale_sentences	Anthony also said, "Farewell."
sadness	fairytale_sentences	Not a tear came into his eye; he felt he was no longer Molly's friend.
anger	fairytale_sentences	Hot iron and cold iron alike take the skin from our lips, and we feel the same sensation if we kiss either; and Anthony's kiss was now the kiss of hatred, as it had once been the kiss of love.
sadness	fairytale_sentences	"What matters it?" said he; "I am ruined also.
anger	fairytale_sentences	I will destroy everything that can remind me of her, or of Lady Halle, or Lady Venus, the heathen woman.
anger	fairytale_sentences	I will break down the apple-tree, and tear it up by the roots; never more shall it blossom or bear fruit."
sadness	fairytale_sentences	Dark days, heavy trials, with poverty at the door, came rolling into the house upon them like the waves of the sea.
sadness	fairytale_sentences	Sorrow and suffering deprived Anthony's father of his strength, so that he had something else to think of besides nursing his love-sorrows and his anger against Molly.
surprise	fairytale_sentences	How different the world, and the people in it, appeared to Anthony now, to what he had thought in his childhood!
joy	fairytale_sentences	At times he would think in this way; yet again and again the songs would sound in his soul, and his heart become gentle and pious.
joy	fairytale_sentences	"God's will is the best," he would then say.
joy	fairytale_sentences	All has happened for the best.
disgust	fairytale_sentences	She could not help it, and yet I have been so bitter, and in such enmity against her."
sadness	fairytale_sentences	How much came back to his remembrance as he looked through the tears once more on his native town!
joy	fairytale_sentences	"That flourishes still," said he, as he gazed.
disgust	fairytale_sentences	"The blossoms are often plucked," said Anthony; "the fruit is stolen and the branches broken without a thankful thought of their profusion and beauty.
disgust	fairytale_sentences	Forsaken and forgotten, in a garden by a hedge in a field, and close to a public road.
disgust	fairytale_sentences	There it stands, unsheltered, plundered, and broken.
sadness	fairytale_sentences	It certainly has not yet withered; but in the course of years the number of blossoms from time to time will grow less, and at last it was cease altogether to bear fruit; and then its history will be over."
sadness	fairytale_sentences	"Marry! ha, ha!" and he laughed bitterly to himself at the thought.
sadness	fairytale_sentences	There lay the old bachelor, forsaken by all, and unable to help himself.
joy	fairytale_sentences	A little spider, which he could however not see, busily and cheerfully spun its web above him, so that there should be a kind of little banner waving over the old man, when his eyes closed.
joy	fairytale_sentences	The recollection of her pious deeds was as light to the soul of poor Anthony.
fear	fairytale_sentences	He remembered a story told of her, that on one occasion, when she was carrying a basket full of wine and provisions, her husband, who had watched her footsteps, stepped forward and asked her angrily what she carried in her basket, whereupon, with fear and trembling, she answered, "Roses, which I have plucked from the garden."
surprise	fairytale_sentences	Then he tore away the cloth which covered the basket, and what could equal the surprise of the pious woman, to find that by a miracle, everything in her basket- the wine, the bread- had all been changed into roses.
joy	fairytale_sentences	In this way the memory of the kind lady dwelt in the calm mind of Anthony.
joy	fairytale_sentences	He saw the branches of an apple-tree spreading above him.
joy	fairytale_sentences	The fragrant leaves of the tree fell upon him and cooled his burning brow; upon his parched lips they seemed like refreshing bread and wine; and as they rested on his breast, a peaceful calm stole over him, and he felt inclined to sleep.
joy	fairytale_sentences	Glorious! wonderful!
joy	fairytale_sentences	That apple-tree, planted in love, now appears before me in heavenly beauty."
surprise	fairytale_sentences	"Hallo! how the nightcap burns!" he exclaimed, as he tore it from his bead.
joy	fairytale_sentences	The great city where he resided was very gay; every day many strangers from all parts of the globe arrived.
surprise	fairytale_sentences	"That must be wonderful cloth," thought the emperor.
joy	fairytale_sentences	"If I were to be dressed in a suit made of this cloth I should be able to find out which men in my empire were unfit for their places, and I could distinguish the clever from the stupid.
joy	fairytale_sentences	I must have this cloth woven for me without delay."
joy	fairytale_sentences	"I should very much like to know how they are getting on with the cloth," thought the emperor.
fear	fairytale_sentences	But he felt rather uneasy when he remembered that he who was not fit for his office could not see it.
fear	fairytale_sentences	Personally, he was of opinion that he had nothing to fear, yet he thought it advisable to send somebody else first to see how matters stood.
fear	fairytale_sentences	Everybody in the town knew what a remarkable quality the stuff possessed, and all were anxious to see how bad or stupid their neighbours were.
surprise	fairytale_sentences	"Heaven preserve us!" he thought, and opened his eyes wide, "I cannot see anything at all," but he did not say so.
surprise	fairytale_sentences	The poor old minister tried his very best, but he could see nothing, for there was nothing to be seen.
fear	fairytale_sentences	"Oh dear," he thought, "can I be so stupid?
fear	fairytale_sentences	I should never have thought so, and nobody must know it!
fear	fairytale_sentences	Is it possible that I am not fit for my office?
fear	fairytale_sentences	No, no, I cannot say that I was unable to see the cloth."
joy	fairytale_sentences	"Oh, it is very pretty, exceedingly beautiful," replied the old minister looking through his glasses.
joy	fairytale_sentences	"What a beautiful pattern, what brilliant colours!
joy	fairytale_sentences	I shall tell the emperor that I like the cloth very much."
joy	fairytale_sentences	"We are pleased to hear that," said the two weavers, and described to him the colours and explained the curious pattern.
joy	fairytale_sentences	"Is it not a beautiful piece of cloth?" asked the two swindlers, showing and explaining the magnificent pattern, which, however, did not exist.
disgust	fairytale_sentences	"I am not stupid," said the man.
sadness	fairytale_sentences	"It is therefore my good appointment for which I am not fit.
joy	fairytale_sentences	It is very strange, but I must not let any one know it;" and he praised the cloth, which he did not see, and expressed his joy at the beautiful colours and the fine pattern.
joy	fairytale_sentences	"It is very excellent," he said to the emperor.
joy	fairytale_sentences	"Is it not magnificent?" said the two old statesmen who had been there before.
surprise	fairytale_sentences	"What is this?" thought the emperor, "I do not see anything at all.
joy	fairytale_sentences	"Really," he said, turning to the weavers, "your cloth has our most gracious approval;" and nodding contentedly he looked at the empty loom, for he did not like to say that he saw nothing.
joy	fairytale_sentences	"It is magnificent, beautiful, excellent," one heard them say; everybody seemed to be delighted, and the emperor appointed the two swindlers "Imperial Court weavers."
joy	fairytale_sentences	The emperor and all his barons then came to the hall; the swindlers held their arms up as if they held something in their hands and said: "These are the trousers!"
joy	fairytale_sentences	"This is the coat!" and "Here is the cloak!" and so on.
joy	fairytale_sentences	"They are all as light as a cobweb, and one must feel as if one had nothing at all upon the body; but that is just the beauty of them."
joy	fairytale_sentences	"Indeed!" said all the courtiers; but they could not see anything, for there was nothing to be seen.
joy	fairytale_sentences	"How well they look!
joy	fairytale_sentences	How well they fit!" said all.
joy	fairytale_sentences	"What a beautiful pattern!
joy	fairytale_sentences	What fine colours!
joy	fairytale_sentences	That is a magnificent suit of clothes!"
joy	fairytale_sentences	"Does not my suit fit me marvellously?"
fear	fairytale_sentences	The chamberlains, who were to carry the train, stretched their hands to the ground as if they lifted up a train, and pretended to hold something in their hands; they did not like people to know that they could not see anything.
surprise	fairytale_sentences	The emperor marched in the procession under the beautiful canopy, and all who saw him in the street and out of the windows exclaimed: "Indeed, the emperor's new suit is incomparable!
joy	fairytale_sentences	What a long train he has!
joy	fairytale_sentences	How well it fits him!"
disgust	fairytale_sentences	"But he has nothing on at all," said a little child at last.
sadness	fairytale_sentences	Waldemar Daa remained for a time silent and thoughtful.
sadness	fairytale_sentences	His daughters wept; all the people in the mansion wiped their eyes, but Lady Daa had driven away, and I drove away too," said the Wind.
sadness	fairytale_sentences	Far in the interior of the wood, where a noisy swarm of laborers were working, stood Waldemar Daa and his three daughters, and all were laughing at the wild cries of the birds, excepting one, the youngest, Anna Dorothea, who felt grieved to the heart; and when they made preparations to fell a tree that was almost dead, and on whose naked branches the black stork had built her nest, she saw the poor little things stretching out their necks, and she begged for mercy for them, with the tears in her eyes.
disgust	fairytale_sentences	"'Leave it alone,' I sang down the chimney; 'leave it alone, it will all end in smoke, air, coals, and ashes, and you will burn your fingers.'
disgust	fairytale_sentences	But Waldemar Daa did not leave it alone, and all he possessed vanished like smoke blown by me.
joy	fairytale_sentences	The master of the castle had watched through the night, in feverish excitement, and had been melting and cooling, distilling and mixing.
sadness	fairytale_sentences	I heard him sighing like a soul in despair; I heard him praying, and I noticed how he held his breath.
surprise	fairytale_sentences	'Look at the alchymic glass,' he cried; 'something glows in the crucible, pure and heavy.'
surprise	fairytale_sentences	He lifted it with a trembling hand, and exclaimed in a voice of agitation, 'Gold! gold!'
joy	fairytale_sentences	He was quite giddy, I could have blown him down," said the Wind; "but I only fanned the glowing coals, and accompanied him through the door to the room where his daughter sat shivering.
joy	fairytale_sentences	'Found! found!
joy	fairytale_sentences	Gold! gold!' he shouted, again holding the glass aloft, that it might flash in the sunshine; but his hand trembled, and the alchymic glass fell from it, clattering to the ground, and brake in a thousand pieces.
sadness	fairytale_sentences	Ida and Anna Dorothea wept bitterly, Joanna stood, pale and proud, biting her lips till the blood came; but what could that avail?
sadness	fairytale_sentences	"'O-h, o-h,' she sighed; for people can sigh like the moaning of the wind among the reeds and rushes.
sadness	fairytale_sentences	'O-h, o-h,' she would say, 'no bell sounded at thy burial, Waldemar Daa.
sadness	fairytale_sentences	I suppose he is under the ground now; and Ida- alas! alas! it is not ended yet; miserable that I am!
sadness	fairytale_sentences	Kind Heaven, grant me that I may die.'
sadness	fairytale_sentences	Her eyes were glazing, and her heart breaking; but so it would have been, even had the sun not shone that morning on Anna Dorothea.
surprise	fairytale_sentences	All passed away, passed away!
joy	fairytale_sentences	The sun was shining, the birds were singing, and the confirmed children sang too, holding each other by the hand, for they had no position yet, and they were all equal in the eyes of God.
surprise	fairytale_sentences	When the others arrived at the willow trees, where the confectioner had put up his stall, they said: "Now we are out here; the bell does not in reality exist- it is only something that people imagine!"
joy	fairytale_sentences	"We must try to find out if it is!"
joy	fairytale_sentences	Therefore they let him go alone; and as he walked on, the solitude of the wood produced a feeling of reverence in his breast; but still he heard the little bell about which the others rejoiced, and sometimes, when the wind blew in that direction, he could hear the sounds from the confectioner's stall, where the others were singing at tea.
joy	fairytale_sentences	"I will and must find the bell," he said, "if I have to go to the end of the world."
joy	fairytale_sentences	"Oh, what a splendour!"
joy	fairytale_sentences	The sea, the great majestic sea, which was rolling its long waves against the shore, stretched out before him, and the sun was standing like a large bright altar and there where sea and heaven met- all melted together in the most glowing colours; the wood was singing, and his heart too.
joy	fairytale_sentences	The whole of nature was one large holy church, in which the trees and hovering clouds formed the pillars, the flowers and grass the woven velvet carpet, and heaven itself was the great cupola; up there the flame colour vanished as soon as the sun disappeared, but millions of stars were lighted; diamond lamps were shining, and the king's son stretched his arms out towards heaven, towards the sea, and towards the wood.
joy	fairytale_sentences	And they ran towards each other and took one another's hand, in the great cathedral of nature and poesy, and above them sounded the invisible holy bell; happy spirits surrounded them, singing hallelujahs and rejoicing.
joy	fairytale_sentences	He knew very well that he had enough inside him to buy up all the other toys, and this gave him a very good opinion of his own value.
joy	fairytale_sentences	Upon this there was a great uproar; even the engravings, which hung in frames on the wall, turned round in their excitement, and showed that they had a wrong side to them, although they had not the least intention to expose themselves in this way, or to object to the game.
joy	fairytale_sentences	And as the game was now to begin, all were invited to take part in it, even the children's wagon, which certainly belonged to the coarser playthings.
fear	fairytale_sentences	He stood so high that they were afraid he would not accept a verbal message.
joy	fairytale_sentences	"I crack for everybody," said the cracker.
joy	fairytale_sentences	"Yes, and a fine noise you make," thought the audience, as the play went on.
joy	fairytale_sentences	The doll, whose neck had been darned, was so excited that the place in her neck burst, and the money-pig declared he must do something for one of the players, as they had all pleased him so much.
joy	fairytale_sentences	They all enjoyed the comedy so much, that they gave up all thoughts of the tea party, and only carried out their idea of intellectual amusement, which they called playing at men and women; and there was nothing wrong about it, for it was only play.
surprise	fairytale_sentences	Certainly sooner than he expected- for all at once down he came from the top of the press, fell on the ground, and was broken to pieces.
sadness	fairytale_sentences	She plucks the withered leaf from the balsam, and looks at the grass-covered rampart, on which many children are playing.
sadness	fairytale_sentences	What is the old maid thinking of?
joy	fairytale_sentences	"The poor little children, how happy they are- how merrily they play and romp together!
sadness	fairytale_sentences	What red cheeks and what angels' eyes! but they have no shoes nor stockings.
fear	fairytale_sentences	They dance on the green rampart, just on the place where, according to the old story, the ground always sank in, and where a sportive, frolicsome child had been lured by means of flowers, toys and sweetmeats into an open grave ready dug for it, and which was afterwards closed over the child; and from that moment, the old story says, the ground gave way no longer, the mound remained firm and fast, and was quickly covered with the green turf.
joy	fairytale_sentences	The little people who now play on that spot know nothing of the old tale, else would they fancy they heard a child crying deep below the earth, and the dewdrops on each blade of grass would be to them tears of woe.
sadness	fairytale_sentences	Nor do they know anything of the Danish King who here, in the face of the coming foe, took an oath before all his trembling courtiers that he would hold out with the citizens of his capital, and die here in his nest; they know nothing of the men who have fought here, or of the women who from here have drenched with boiling water the enemy, clad in white, and 'biding in the snow to surprise the city.
sadness	fairytale_sentences	"No! the poor little ones are playing with light, childish spirits.
sadness	fairytale_sentences	Play on, play on, thou little maiden!
fear	fairytale_sentences	Soon the years will come- yes, those glorious years.
sadness	fairytale_sentences	The priestly hands have been laid on the candidates for confirmation; hand in hand they walk on the green rampart.
sadness	fairytale_sentences	Thou hast a white frock on; it has cost thy mother much labor, and yet it is only cut down for thee out of an old larger dress!
anger	fairytale_sentences	You will also wear a red shawl; and what if it hang too far down?
sadness	fairytale_sentences	People will only see how large, how very large it is.
joy	fairytale_sentences	You are thinking of your dress, and of the Giver of all good- so glorious is it to wander on the green rampart!
joy	fairytale_sentences	"And the years roll by; they have no lack of dark days, but you have your cheerful young spirit, and you have gained a friend- you know not how.
surprise	fairytale_sentences	You met, oh, how often!
joy	fairytale_sentences	You walk together on the rampart in the fresh spring, on the high days and holidays, when all the world come out to walk upon the ramparts, and all the bells of the church steeples seem to be singing a song of praise for the coming spring.
sadness	fairytale_sentences	Alas!
sadness	fairytale_sentences	It is not so with the human heart!
sadness	fairytale_sentences	Dark mists, more in number than those that cover the northern skies, cloud the human heart.
sadness	fairytale_sentences	Poor child! thy friend's bridal chamber is a black coffin, and thou becomest an old maid.
sadness	fairytale_sentences	From the almshouse window, behind the balsams, thou shalt look on the merry children at play, and shalt see thine own history renewed."
sadness	fairytale_sentences	And that is the life drama that passes before the old maid while she looks out upon the rampart, the green, sunny rampart, where the children, with their red cheeks and bare shoeless feet, are rejoicing merrily, like the other free little birds.
anger	fairytale_sentences	But inside the church the pastor stood in the pulpit, and spoke very loudly and angrily.
anger	fairytale_sentences	He said that all men were wicked, and God would punish them for their sins, and that the wicked, when they died, would be cast into hell, to burn for ever and ever.
anger	fairytale_sentences	He spoke very excitedly, saying that their evil propensities would not be destroyed, nor would the fire be extinguished, and they should never find rest.
fear	fairytale_sentences	It was dreadful to hear all that, for the preacher spoke from his heart, and all the people in the church were terrified.
joy	fairytale_sentences	Meanwhile, the birds sang merrily outside, and the sun was shining so beautifully warm, it seemed as though every little flower said: "God, Thy kindness towards us all is without limits."
sadness	fairytale_sentences	The same evening, upon going to bed, the pastor noticed his wife sitting there quiet and pensive.
fear	fairytale_sentences	Alas! eternally- how long!
surprise	fairytale_sentences	No, I am unable to imagine that, although you say so."
sadness	fairytale_sentences	She was buried; two large tears rolled over the cheeks of the earnest man, and in the parsonage it was empty and still, for its sun had set for ever.
sadness	fairytale_sentences	She fixed her eyes upon him with such a kind and sad expression, just as if she wished to say something to him.
surprise	fairytale_sentences	The pastor raised himself in bed and stretched his arms towards her, saying, "Not even you can find eternal rest!
surprise	fairytale_sentences	You suffer, you best and most pious woman?"
surprise	fairytale_sentences	"And can I not obtain rest in the grave for you?"
surprise	fairytale_sentences	"Yes, therein, as I believed, as I knew it," said the pastor, "are living those who are abandoned to the eternal fire."
surprise	fairytale_sentences	"He is but a poor fool, and not doomed to be tortured eternally by fire!"
surprise	fairytale_sentences	"Only a fool!"
surprise	fairytale_sentences	"He is ill!
surprise	fairytale_sentences	That is madness- a joyless madness- besieged by fear and dreadful dreams!"
anger	fairytale_sentences	Like a ferocious animal, one of them rose out of his sleep and uttered a horrible cry, and gave his comrade a violent dig in the ribs with his pointed elbow, and this one turned round in his sleep: "Be quiet, monster- sleep!
anger	fairytale_sentences	This happens every night!"
anger	fairytale_sentences	"Every night!" repeated the other.
anger	fairytale_sentences	"Yes, every night he comes and tortures me!
sadness	fairytale_sentences	I myself helped to rescue cattle and things, nothing alive burnt, except a flight of pigeons, which flew into the fire, and the yard dog, of which I had not thought; one could hear him howl out of the fire, and this howling I still hear when I wish to sleep; and when I have fallen asleep, the great rough dog comes and places himself upon me, and howls, presses, and tortures me.
anger	fairytale_sentences	You can snore; you are snoring the whole night, and I hardly a quarter of an hour!"
anger	fairytale_sentences	And the blood rose to the head of the excited criminal; he threw himself upon his comrade, and beat him with his clenced fist in the face.
fear	fairytale_sentences	The pastor's hand trembled; he dared not stretch it out, he did not venture to pull a hair out of the sinner's head.
fear	fairytale_sentences	"Father of all mercy, grant Thou to her the peace that I was unable to procure for her!"
joy	fairytale_sentences	"I have it now!" said the dead woman.
sadness	fairytale_sentences	"WHENEVER a good child dies, an angel of God comes down from heaven, takes the dead child in his arms, spreads out his great white wings, and flies with him over all the places which the child had loved during his life.
joy	fairytale_sentences	Then he gathers a large handful of flowers, which he carries up to the Almighty, that they may bloom more brightly in heaven than they do on earth.
joy	fairytale_sentences	And the Almighty presses the flowers to His heart, but He kisses the flower that pleases Him best, and it receives a voice, and is able to join the song of the chorus of bliss."
joy	fairytale_sentences	Then they passed over well-known spots, where the little one had often played, and through beautiful gardens full of lovely flowers.
joy	fairytale_sentences	"Which of these shall we take with us to heaven to be transplanted there?" asked the angel.
sadness	fairytale_sentences	Close by grew a slender, beautiful, rose-bush, but some wicked hand had broken the stem, and the half-opened rosebuds hung faded and withered on the trailing branches.
sadness	fairytale_sentences	"Poor rose-bush!" said the child, "let us take it with us to heaven, that it may bloom above in God's garden."
joy	fairytale_sentences	The angel took up the rose-bush; then he kissed the child, and the little one half opened his eyes.
joy	fairytale_sentences	The angel gathered also some beautiful flowers, as well as a few humble buttercups and heart's-ease.
joy	fairytale_sentences	"Now we have flowers enough," said the child; but the angel only nodded, he did not fly upward to heaven.
fear	fairytale_sentences	It was night, and quite still in the great town.
sadness	fairytale_sentences	Amidst all this confusion, the angel pointed to the pieces of a broken flower-pot, and to a lump of earth which had fallen out of it.
sadness	fairytale_sentences	The earth had been kept from falling to pieces by the roots of a withered field-flower, which had been thrown amongst the rubbish.
joy	fairytale_sentences	"We will take this with us," said the angel, "I will tell you why as we fly along."
sadness	fairytale_sentences	"Down in that narrow lane, in a low cellar, lived a poor sick boy; he had been afflicted from his childhood, and even in his best days he could just manage to walk up and down the room on crutches once or twice, but no more.
sadness	fairytale_sentences	In this spot the poor sick boy would sit warming himself in the sunshine, and watching the red blood through his delicate fingers as he held them before his face.
surprise	fairytale_sentences	Then he would say he had been out, yet he knew nothing of the green forest in its spring verdure, till a neighbor's son brought him a green bough from a beech-tree.
joy	fairytale_sentences	This he would place over his head, and fancy that he was in the beech-wood while the sun shone, and the birds carolled gayly.
surprise	fairytale_sentences	One spring day the neighbor's boy brought him some field-flowers, and among them was one to which the root still adhered.
joy	fairytale_sentences	This he carefully planted in a flower-pot, and placed in a window-seat near his bed.
joy	fairytale_sentences	And the flower had been planted by a fortunate hand, for it grew, put forth fresh shoots, and blossomed every year.
joy	fairytale_sentences	It became a splendid flower-garden to the sick boy, and his little treasure upon earth.
joy	fairytale_sentences	He watered it, and cherished it, and took care it should have the benefit of every sunbeam that found its way into the cellar, from the earliest morning ray to the evening sunset.
joy	fairytale_sentences	The flower entwined itself even in his dreams- for him it bloomed, for him spread its perfume.
joy	fairytale_sentences	And it gladdened his eyes, and to the flower he turned, even in death, when the Lord called him.
sadness	fairytale_sentences	He has been one year with God.
sadness	fairytale_sentences	During that time the flower has stood in the window, withered and forgotten, till at length cast out among the sweepings into the street, on the day of the lodgers' removal.
joy	fairytale_sentences	And this poor flower, withered and faded as it is, we have added to our nosegay, because it gave more real joy than the most beautiful flower in the garden of a queen."
surprise	fairytale_sentences	"But how do you know all this?" asked the child whom the angel was carrying to heaven.
joy	fairytale_sentences	"I know it," said the angel, "because I myself was the poor sick boy who walked upon crutches, and I know my own flower well."
joy	fairytale_sentences	Then the child opened his eyes and looked into the glorious happy face of the angel, and at the same moment they found themselves in that heavenly home where all is happiness and joy.
joy	fairytale_sentences	And God pressed the dead child to His heart, and wings were given him so that he could fly with the angel, hand in hand.
joy	fairytale_sentences	Then the Almighty pressed all the flowers to His heart; but He kissed the withered field-flower, and it received a voice.
joy	fairytale_sentences	Then it joined in the song of the angels, who surrounded the throne, some near, and others in a distant circle, but all equally happy.
joy	fairytale_sentences	They all joined in the chorus of praise, both great and small,- the good, happy child, and the poor field-flower, that once lay withered and cast away on a heap of rubbish in a narrow, dark street.
sadness	fairytale_sentences	Well, perhaps, if in the beginning of a book these were written and printed, many, when they read it, would lay the book down and say, "It seems to me a very miserable title, I don't like things of this sort."
joy	fairytale_sentences	So I have inherited from him, not only my good temper, but a habit of going often to the churchyard, which is good, when done in a proper humor; and then also I take in the Intelligencer, just as he used to do.
joy	fairytale_sentences	I am not very young, I have neither wife nor children, nor a library, but, as I said, I read the Intelligencer, which is enough for me; it is to me a delightful paper, and so it was to my father.
surprise	fairytale_sentences	And then what a number of subscriptions to charities, and what innocent verses!
joy	fairytale_sentences	The newspaper and the churchyard were always exciting objects to me.
sadness	fairytale_sentences	Here, behind the white iron railings, once a rose-tree grew; it is gone now, but a little bit of evergreen, from a neighboring grave, stretches out its green tendrils, and makes some appearance; there rests a very unhappy man, and yet while he lived he might be said to occupy a very good position.
anger	fairytale_sentences	He had enough to live upon, and something to spare; but owing to his refined tastes the least thing in the world annoyed him.
anger	fairytale_sentences	If he went to a theatre of an evening, instead of enjoying himself he would be quite annoyed if the machinist had put too strong a light into one side of the moon, or if the representations of the sky hung over the scenes when they ought to have hung behind them; or if a palm-tree was introduced into a scene representing the Zoological Gardens of Berlin, or a cactus in a view of Tyrol, or a beech-tree in the north of Norway.
surprise	fairytale_sentences	As if these things were of any consequence!
surprise	fairytale_sentences	Why did he not leave them alone?
surprise	fairytale_sentences	Who would trouble themselves about such trifles? especially at a comedy, where every one is expected to be amused.
joy	fairytale_sentences	It is beautiful to observe how wisely nature orders these things.
surprise	fairytale_sentences	Here rests,- ah, it makes one feel mournful to think of him!- but here rests a man who, during sixty-seven years, was never remembered to have said a good thing; he lived only in the hope of having a good idea.
joy	fairytale_sentences	At last he felt convinced, in his own mind, that he really had one, and was so delighted that he positively died of joy at the thought of having at last caught an idea.
surprise	fairytale_sentences	I come here often, and if any of my friends, or those who are not my friends, are too much for me, I go out and choose a plot of ground in which to bury him or her.
surprise	fairytale_sentences	Then I bury them, as it were; there they lie, dead and powerless, till they come back new and better characters.
surprise	fairytale_sentences	Then, if any of our friends act absurdly, no one need to be vexed about it.
joy	fairytale_sentences	Let them bury the offenders out of sight, and keep their good temper.
joy	fairytale_sentences	"The man with a cheerful temper."
sadness	fairytale_sentences	Grandmother says that she has heard her own grandmother tell of him; he is said to lead a solitary life, and to have nobody with whom he can converse save the great old church Bell.
joy	fairytale_sentences	"Ding-dong! ding-dong!" sounded the Bell, when the tower still stood there; and one evening, while the sun was setting, and the Bell was swinging away bravely, it broke loose and came flying down through the air, the brilliant metal shining in the ruddy beam.
joy	fairytale_sentences	"Ding-dong! ding-dong!
joy	fairytale_sentences	Now I'll retire to rest!" sang the Bell, and flew down into the Odense-Au, where it is deepest; and that is why the place is called the "bell-deep."
sadness	fairytale_sentences	But the Bell got neither rest nor sleep.
joy	fairytale_sentences	Down in the Au-mann's haunt it sounds and rings, so that the tones sometimes pierce upward through the waters; and many people maintain that its strains forebode the death of some one; but that is not true, for the Bell is only talking with the Au-mann, who is now no longer alone.
joy	fairytale_sentences	Ding-dong! ding-dong!"
sadness	fairytale_sentences	I may sing of everything that is kept concealed behind lock and bars.
sadness	fairytale_sentences	Yonder it is cold and wet.
fear	fairytale_sentences	The rats are eating her up alive!
sadness	fairytale_sentences	Nobody knows of it!
sadness	fairytale_sentences	Nobody hears of it!
sadness	fairytale_sentences	Not even now, for the bell is ringing and singing its loud Ding-dong, ding-dong!'
fear	fairytale_sentences	He sought shelter in the church, and shut gate and door behind him.
sadness	fairytale_sentences	The throng in front of the church knew where they could hit the King, and one of them flung a stone through a pane of glass, and the King lay there dead!
joy	fairytale_sentences	"The church bell hangs high, and looks far around, and sees the birds around it, and understands their language.
joy	fairytale_sentences	The wind roars in upon it through windows and loopholes; and the wind knows everything, for he gets it from the air, which encircles all things, and the church bell understands his tongue, and rings it out into the world, 'Ding-dong! ding-dong!'
sadness	fairytale_sentences	"But it was too much for me to hear and to know; I was not able any longer to ring it out.
sadness	fairytale_sentences	I became so tired, so heavy, that the beam broke, and I flew out into the gleaming Au, where the water is deepest, and where the Au-mann lives, solitary and alone; and year by year I tell him what I have heard and what I know.
sadness	fairytale_sentences	But the schoolmaster says that there was not any bell that rung down there, for that it could not do so; and that no Au-mann dwelt yonder, for there was no Au-mann at all!
fear	fairytale_sentences	"Be cautious, cautious, and take good heed to thyself," they both say.
joy	fairytale_sentences	It is around us, it is in us, it talks of our thoughts and of our deeds, and it speaks longer of them than does the Bell down in the depths of the Odense-Au where the Au-mann dwells.
sadness	fairytale_sentences	The elder one, who was named Care, looked rather gloomy; she always goes about to perform her own business in person; for then she knows it is properly done.
joy	fairytale_sentences	"I must tell you," said she, "that to-day is my birthday; and in honor of it I have been intrusted with a pair of goloshes, to introduce amongst mankind.
surprise	fairytale_sentences	"What odd figures!" thought he; "they must be returning from some masquerade."
surprise	fairytale_sentences	The astonished counsellor asked what it all meant, and who the gentleman might be.
surprise	fairytale_sentences	"Good gracious!" he exclaimed; "what in the world has happened to the bishop? what can he be thinking about?"
surprise	fairytale_sentences	Then he shook his head and said, "It cannot possibly be the bishop himself."
anger	fairytale_sentences	"It is shameful that the lamps are not lighted here, and it is as muddy as if one were walking in a marsh."
anger	fairytale_sentences	"I don't understand your outlandish talk," he cried at last, angrily turning his back upon them.
surprise	fairytale_sentences	"Dear me, what have they been erecting here?" he cried, as he caught sight of the East gate, which in olden times used to stand at the end of East Street.
surprise	fairytale_sentences	"Either I behold a fata morgana, or I must be tipsy," groaned the counsellor.
surprise	fairytale_sentences	What is the matter with me?"
anger	fairytale_sentences	But I cannot bear even that, and it was very foolish to give us punch and hot salmon; I shall speak about it to our hostess, the agent's lady.
fear	fairytale_sentences	"This is really frightful; I cannot even recognize East Street.
surprise	fairytale_sentences	Not a shop to be seen; nothing but old, wretched, tumble-down houses, just as if I were at Roeskilde or Ringstedt.
fear	fairytale_sentences	Oh, I really must be ill!
surprise	fairytale_sentences	Oh dear!
surprise	fairytale_sentences	I certainly am very queer."
surprise	fairytale_sentences	"Is that to-day's number of the Day?" he asked, quite mechanically, as he saw the woman putting by a large piece of paper.
joy	fairytale_sentences	"That is very old," said the counsellor, becoming quite cheerful at the sight of this antique drawing.
joy	fairytale_sentences	"Where did you get this singular sheet?
joy	fairytale_sentences	"Modestia is a beautiful virtue," said the man.
joy	fairytale_sentences	"Oh yes," replied the counsellor; "I am very fond of reading useful old books, and modern ones as well, with the exception of every-day stories, of which we really have more than enough.
surprise	fairytale_sentences	"Every-day stories?" asked the bachelor.
joy	fairytale_sentences	"Oh," replied the man, with a smile; "and yet they are very witty, and are much read at Court.
surprise	fairytale_sentences	"Goodness me! where am I?" said he.
surprise	fairytale_sentences	It bewildered him as he thought of it.
fear	fairytale_sentences	The counsellor felt a cold shiver run all over him.
surprise	fairytale_sentences	"What is this? what does it mean?" said he; but he was obliged to drink with them, for they overpowered the good man with their politeness.
surprise	fairytale_sentences	"One might believe that the country was going back to heathenism," he observed.
joy	fairytale_sentences	"Yes, this is East Street; how beautifully bright and gay it looks!
joy	fairytale_sentences	He thought of all the terror and anxiety which he had undergone, and felt thankful from his heart for the reality and comfort of modern times, which, with all their errors, were far better than those in which he so lately found himself.
sadness	fairytale_sentences	The riches and the honor came for me; Yet still my greatest wealth was poverty: Ah, help and pity me!
sadness	fairytale_sentences	Thou knowest: ah, pity me!
sadness	fairytale_sentences	The lieutenant felt this very keenly, and therefore leaned his head against the window-frame, and sighed deeply.
sadness	fairytale_sentences	"The poor watchman in the street," said he, "is far happier than I am.
sadness	fairytale_sentences	Oh, how much happier I should be could I change my being and position with him, and pass through life with his humble expectations and hopes!
sadness	fairytale_sentences	Yes, he is indeed happier than I am."
fear	fairytale_sentences	All his comrades were very much frightened, for he seemed quite dead; still they allowed him to remain after they had given notice of what had happened; and at dawn the body was carried to the hospital.
fear	fairytale_sentences	He declared, when he quite recovered himself, that this had been the most dreadful night he had ever passed; not for a hundred pounds would he go through such feelings again.
anger	fairytale_sentences	His first feeling was one of anger, and then his spirits sank below zero.
joy	fairytale_sentences	"What a free, happy man you are.
joy	fairytale_sentences	This is a splendid spring day for a poet, the air is so remarkably clear, the clouds are so beautiful, and the green grass has such a sweet smell.
joy	fairytale_sentences	For many years I have not felt as I do at this moment."
joy	fairytale_sentences	"What a delightful perfume," said he; "it reminds me of the violets at Aunt Lora's.
sadness	fairytale_sentences	Yes, this is my fate," and he sighed deeply.
joy	fairytale_sentences	It is overpowering, and yet it is delightful."
joy	fairytale_sentences	As the clerk thought of all these things, and became conscious of the great change in his own feelings, he smiled, and said to himself, "I must be asleep and dreaming; and yet, if so, how wonderful for a dream to be so natural and real, and to know at the same time too that it is but a dream.
sadness	fairytale_sentences	"Ah!" he sighed mournfully, as he gazed at the birds singing merrily, or hopping from branch to branch, "they are much better off than I. Flying is a glorious power.
joy	fairytale_sentences	He felt what was taking place, and laughed to himself.
joy	fairytale_sentences	"Well," thought he, "this is charming; by day I sit in a police-office, amongst the dryest law papers, and at night I can dream that I am a lark, flying about in the gardens of Fredericksburg.
sadness	fairytale_sentences	It is a miserable story indeed, especially now I have fallen into the hands of boys.
anger	fairytale_sentences	The boys carried him into a very elegant room, where a stout, pleasant-looking lady received them, but she was not at all gratified to find that they had brought a lark- a common field-bird as she called it.
joy	fairytale_sentences	"It will please Polly perhaps," she said, laughing at a large gray parrot, who was swinging himself proudly on a ring in a handsome brass cage.
joy	fairytale_sentences	Ha! ha! ha!" laughed Polly, and repeated his witty saying, "Now let us be men."
fear	fairytale_sentences	The canary-bird fluttered in his cage, and the parrot flapped his wings and cried, "Let us be men;" the poor clerk, in the most deadly terror, flew through the window, over the houses, and through the streets, till at length he was obliged to seek a resting-place.
joy	fairytale_sentences	"Oh, to travel, to travel!" cried he; "there is no greater happiness in the world: it is the height of my ambition.
sadness	fairytale_sentences	"Ah," he sighed, "if I were only on the other side of the Alps now, it would be summer, and I should be able to get money on my letter of credit.
sadness	fairytale_sentences	Oh, I wish I was on the other side of the Alps."
sadness	fairytale_sentences	It was a glorious spectacle; but the stomachs of the travellers were empty, their bodies exhausted with fatigue, and all the longings of their heart turned towards a resting-place for the night; but where to find one they knew not.
sadness	fairytale_sentences	All the eyes were too eagerly seeking for this resting-place, to notice the beauties of nature.
joy	fairytale_sentences	THERE was once a butterfly who wished for a bride, and, as may be supposed, he wanted to choose a very pretty one from among the flowers.
joy	fairytale_sentences	The butterfly came also to Marguerite to inquire, but he did not pluck off her leaves; he pressed a kiss on each of them, for he thought there was always more to be done by kindness.
anger	fairytale_sentences	But Marguerite did not answer him; she was offended that he should call her a woman when she was only a girl; and there is a great difference.
joy	fairytale_sentences	"They are very pretty," thought the butterfly; "charming little lasses; but they are rather formal."
sadness	fairytale_sentences	The violet, a little too sentimental.
joy	fairytale_sentences	The pea-blossom pleased him most of all; she was white and red, graceful and slender, and belonged to those domestic maidens who have a pretty appearance, and can yet be useful in the kitchen.
joy	fairytale_sentences	You know, this plant has no blossom; but it is sweetness all over,- full of fragrance from head to foot, with the scent of a flower in every leaf.
joy	fairytale_sentences	"I will take her," said the butterfly; and he made her an offer.
joy	fairytale_sentences	He could exist here, he said, well enough.
sadness	fairytale_sentences	"But it is not enough merely to exist," said he, "I need freedom, sunshine, and a little flower for a companion."
joy	fairytale_sentences	Then he flew against the window-pane, and was seen and admired by those in the room, who caught him, and stuck him on a pin, in a box of curiosities.
sadness	fairytale_sentences	"It is not very pleasant, certainly; I should imagine it is something like being married; for here I am stuck fast."
sadness	fairytale_sentences	"That seems very poor consolation," said one of the plants in the room, that grew in a pot.
joy	fairytale_sentences	"Look at me," said the top to the ball.
joy	fairytale_sentences	No one could be happier than we should be."
joy	fairytale_sentences	Every time I fly up in the air, he puts his head out of the nest, and says, 'Will you?' and I have said, 'Yes,' to myself silently, and that is as good as being half engaged; but I will promise never to forget you."
anger	fairytale_sentences	"Much good that will be to me," said the top; and they spoke to each other no more.
sadness	fairytale_sentences	The boy searched everywhere for it, but he searched in vain, for it could not be found; it was gone.
sadness	fairytale_sentences	"I know very well where she is," sighed the top; "she is in the swallow's nest, and has married the swallow."
sadness	fairytale_sentences	The more the top thought of this, the more he longed for the ball.
joy	fairytale_sentences	"Now I am in a nice place," said he; "my gilding will soon be washed off here.
sadness	fairytale_sentences	The sisters mourned as young hearts can mourn, and were especially grieved at the sight of their parents' sorrow.
sadness	fairytale_sentences	The father's heart was bowed down, but the mother sunk completely under the deep grief.
sadness	fairytale_sentences	She thought God could not take her darling little one from her; and when it did happen notwithstanding her hopes and her belief, and there could be no more doubt on the subject, she said in her feverish agony, "God does not know it.
sadness	fairytale_sentences	Thus in her great grief she fell away from her faith in God, and dark thoughts arose in her mind respecting death and a future state.
sadness	fairytale_sentences	But these doubts were no support to her, nothing on which she could rest, and she sunk into the fathomless depths of despair.
sadness	fairytale_sentences	In her darkest hours she ceased to weep, and thought not of the young daughters who were still left to her.
sadness	fairytale_sentences	The tears of her husband fell on her forehead, but she took no notice of him; her thoughts were with her dead child; her whole existence seemed wrapped up in the remembrances of the little one and of every innocent word it had uttered.
sadness	fairytale_sentences	When she awoke, and wanted to see her child, the husband, with tears, said, "We have closed the coffin; it was necessary to do so."
sadness	fairytale_sentences	"When God is so hard to me, how can I expect men to be better?" she said with groans and tears.
sadness	fairytale_sentences	She gave herself up to her grief, and it tossed her to and fro, as the sea tosses a ship without compass or rudder.
sadness	fairytale_sentences	With tearful eyes and mournful glances, the sorrowing daughters and the afflicted husband looked upon her who would not hear their words of comfort; and, indeed, what comforting words could they speak, when they were themselves so full of grief?
sadness	fairytale_sentences	As she had sat by his little cot, so now she sat by his grave; and here she could weep freely, and her tears fell upon it.
sadness	fairytale_sentences	"Down to my child," she repeated; and tones of despair and entreaty sounded in the words.
joy	fairytale_sentences	"My sweet, darling mother," she heard the child say.
joy	fairytale_sentences	It was the well-known, beloved voice; and kiss followed kiss, in boundless delight.
joy	fairytale_sentences	"There is nothing so beautiful on earth as it is here.
joy	fairytale_sentences	Oh, it is happiness indeed."
joy	fairytale_sentences	"I can fly now, mother," said the child; "I can fly with other happy children into the presence of the Almighty.
sadness	fairytale_sentences	"Oh, stay, stay!" implored the mother; "only one moment more; only once more, that I may look upon thee, and kiss thee, and press thee to my heart."
fear	fairytale_sentences	And then she remembered those she left behind, and a great terror came over her.
sadness	fairytale_sentences	No; their sighs and lamentations still sounded from above; and she had nearly forgotten them, for the sake of him who was dead.
joy	fairytale_sentences	And when she had offered this prayer, her heart felt lighter.
joy	fairytale_sentences	Everything around her seemed holy, and her heart was chastened.
joy	fairytale_sentences	She bent over her husband, who still slept; her warm, devoted kiss awakened him, and words of heartfelt love fell from the lips of both.
joy	fairytale_sentences	Now she was gentle and strong as a wife can be; and from her lips came the words of faith: "Whatever He doeth is right and best."
joy	fairytale_sentences	And as she kissed him and her children, she said, "It came from God, through my child in the grave."
joy	fairytale_sentences	"I obtained the first prize," said the hare.
joy	fairytale_sentences	"I should imagine no one can be swifter in soaring and flight than I am; and how far I have been! far, far away."
anger	fairytale_sentences	"I deserved the first prize, and not the second," said the snail.
anger	fairytale_sentences	"What a buzzing and a rumbling there is in the elfin hill," said one of the lizards; "I have not been able to close my eyes for two nights on account of the noise; I might just as well have had the toothache, for that always keeps me awake."
anger	fairytale_sentences	"Boys," said the old man, "a hole goes in, and a hill stands out; have you no eyes in your heads?"
anger	fairytale_sentences	"Take care," said the old man, "or people will think you have not been well brought up."
anger	fairytale_sentences	"Feet off the table-cloth!" said the old goblin.
sadness	fairytale_sentences	"No one cares for me, nor troubles himself about me; and I have enough to do to sew my grave clothes."
anger	fairytale_sentences	"What tricks have you been playing?" said the old goblin.
sadness	fairytale_sentences	Just then a large old carriage came by, and in it sat an old lady; she looked at the little girl, and taking pity on her, said to the clergyman, "Look here, if you will give me the little girl, I will take care of her."
fear	fairytale_sentences	She was frightened, and wanted to throw the red shoes away; but they stuck fast.
fear	fairytale_sentences	"Mercy!" cried Karen.
fear	fairytale_sentences	"Don't cut off my head!" said Karen, "for then I could not repent of my sin.
fear	fairytale_sentences	And she went quickly up to the church-door; but when she came there, the red shoes were dancing before her, and she was frightened, and turned back.
sadness	fairytale_sentences	During the whole week she was sad and wept many bitter tears, but when Sunday came again she said: "Now I have suffered and striven enough.
fear	fairytale_sentences	Then she became terrified, and turned back and repented right heartily of her sin.
sadness	fairytale_sentences	On the following Sunday they all went to church, and she was asked whether she wished to go too; but, with tears in her eyes, she looked sadly at her crutches.
sadness	fairytale_sentences	Here she sat down with her hymn-book, and as she was reading it with a pious mind, the wind carried the notes of the organ over to her from the church, and in tears she lifted up her face and said: "O God! help me!"
sadness	fairytale_sentences	The old grandfather wiped his eyes, for he had known King Frederick, with his silvery locks and his honest blue eyes, and had lived for him, and he folded his hands and remained for some time silent.
sadness	fairytale_sentences	I still remember his face, but from whence he came, or whither he went, I know not; no one knows.
anger	fairytale_sentences	"Thou child of perdition, I will yet carry out my purpose!" cried the Bishop of Borglum.
anger	fairytale_sentences	"Now will I lay the hand of the Pope upon thee, to summon thee before the tribunal that shall condemn thee!"
fear	fairytale_sentences	They fear an attack from the armed followers of the robber-knights.
sadness	fairytale_sentences	Then one of them mentioned Thyland in Denmark, and spoke of her sorrows, of her woes, which were soon to cease, for so Divine Providence had willed it.
anger	fairytale_sentences	"Thou Borglum bishop," he exclaims, "I shall subdue thee after all!
anger	fairytale_sentences	Under the shield of the Pope, the law cannot reach thee; but Jens Glob shall reach thee!"
anger	fairytale_sentences	"It is stupid nonsense to allow yourself to shoot out in this way; we are not here to support you."
sadness	fairytale_sentences	Not long after, the king of the country suffered from the deepest melancholy.
sadness	fairytale_sentences	They read deep and learned books to him, and then the lightest and most trifling that could be found, but all to no purpose.
fear	fairytale_sentences	Then said the swineherd, "I am afraid I carried this plant away from the forest in my bundle, and it has been burnt to ashes long ago.
fear	fairytale_sentences	But I did not know any better."
anger	fairytale_sentences	Ignorance upon ignorance indeed!"
sadness	fairytale_sentences	The poor swineherd took these words to heart, for they were addressed to him; he knew not that there were others who were equally ignorant.
sadness	fairytale_sentences	Then the king, in his melancholy, wandered out to the spot in the wood.
sadness	fairytale_sentences	For the plant had disappeared, and the king remained as melancholy and sad as ever, but the sentry said he had always been so.
fear	fairytale_sentences	And again little Tuk lay in his bed, scarcely knowing whether he was dreaming or not, for some one stood by him.
sadness	fairytale_sentences	In the cold and the darkness, a poor little girl, with bare head and naked feet, roamed through the streets.
sadness	fairytale_sentences	No one had bought anything of her the whole day, nor had any one given here even a penny.
sadness	fairytale_sentences	Shivering with cold and hunger, she crept along; poor little child, she looked the picture of misery.
sadness	fairytale_sentences	In a corner, between two houses, one of which projected beyond the other, she sank down and huddled herself together.
fear	fairytale_sentences	She had drawn her little feet under her, but she could not keep off the cold; and she dared not go home, for she had sold no matches, and could not take home even a penny of money.
fear	fairytale_sentences	Her father would certainly beat her; besides, it was almost as cold at home as here, for they had only the roof to cover them, through which the wind howled, although the largest holes had been stopped up with straw and rags.
sadness	fairytale_sentences	Then the match went out, and there remained nothing but the thick, damp, cold wall before her.
sadness	fairytale_sentences	"Some one is dying," thought the little girl, for her old grandmother, the only one who had ever loved her, and who was now dead, had told her that when a star falls, a soul was going up to God.
sadness	fairytale_sentences	"Grandmother," cried the little one, "O take me with you; I know you will go away when the match burns out; you will vanish like the warm stove, the roast goose, and the large, glorious Christmas-tree."
anger	fairytale_sentences	But the tulips stood more stiffly than ever, their faces were pointed and red, because they were vexed.
sadness	fairytale_sentences	The peonies were sulky; it was well that they could not speak, otherwise they would have given the daisy a good lecture.
sadness	fairytale_sentences	The little flower could very well see that they were ill at ease, and pitied them sincerely.
sadness	fairytale_sentences	Indeed the poor bird had good reason to be sad, for it had been caught and put into a cage close by the open window.
sadness	fairytale_sentences	The poor lark was most unhappy as a prisoner in a cage.
fear	fairytale_sentences	"Pluck the flower off" said the other boy, and the daisy trembled for fear, for to be pulled off meant death to it; and it wished so much to live, as it was to go with the square of turf into the poor captive lark's cage.
sadness	fairytale_sentences	The poor bird was lamenting its lost liberty, and beating its wings against the wires; and the little daisy could not speak or utter a consoling word, much as it would have liked to do so.
sadness	fairytale_sentences	"I have no water," said the captive lark, "they have all gone out, and forgotten to give me anything to drink.
sadness	fairytale_sentences	My throat is dry and burning.
sadness	fairytale_sentences	I feel as if I had fire and ice within me, and the air is so oppressive.
sadness	fairytale_sentences	I must die, and part with the warm sunshine, the fresh green meadows, and all the beauty that God has created."
sadness	fairytale_sentences	Then it noticed the little daisy, and nodded to it, and kissed it with its beak and said: "You must also fade in here, poor little flower.
sadness	fairytale_sentences	Alas! you only remind me of what I have lost."
sadness	fairytale_sentences	The evening came, and nobody appeared to bring the poor bird a drop of water; it opened its beautiful wings, and fluttered about in its anguish; a faint and mournful "Tweet, tweet," was all it could utter, then it bent its little head towards the flower, and its heart broke for want and longing.
sadness	fairytale_sentences	The flower could not, as on the previous evening, fold up its petals and sleep; it dropped sorrowfully.
sadness	fairytale_sentences	The boys only came the next morning; when they saw the dead bird, they began to cry bitterly, dug a nice grave for it, and adorned it with flowers.
sadness	fairytale_sentences	While it was alive and sang they forgot it, and let it suffer want in the cage; now, they cried over it and covered it with flowers.
fear	fairytale_sentences	I cannot sleep alone to-night.
anger	fairytale_sentences	"Prenez garde aux enfants!" said father owl; "children should not hear such things."
fear	fairytale_sentences	"Wake up! wake up!" crowed the cock, and flew upon his board.
fear	fairytale_sentences	Sleep was still in his eyes, but yet he crowed out: "Three hens have died of their unfortunate love for a cock.
sadness	fairytale_sentences	The corpse lay in a bedroom, near to the one in which we sat, and the old man was in great distress and weeping like a child.
sadness	fairytale_sentences	He spoke to my father, and to a few neighbors who were there, of how lonely he should feel now she was gone, and how good and true she, his dead wife, had been during the number of years that they had passed through life together, and how they had become acquainted, and learnt to love each other.
sadness	fairytale_sentences	And the old man who had spoken of all this shook his head mournfully, and said, "Forgotten!
sadness	fairytale_sentences	Ah, yes, everything will be forgotten!"
sadness	fairytale_sentences	But care and sorrow dwelt within these halls; the queen lay upon a sick bed, and the doctors declared that she must die.
fear	fairytale_sentences	When she heard the farmer coming she was frightened, and begged the sexton to hide himself in a large empty chest that stood in the room.
fear	fairytale_sentences	He did so, for he knew her husband could not endure the sight of a sexton.
fear	fairytale_sentences	The woman then quickly put away the wine, and hid all the rest of the nice things in the oven; for if her husband had seen them he would have asked what they were brought out for.
fear	fairytale_sentences	The woman dared not say anything; so she placed the things before them, and they both ate of the fish, the meat, and the pastry.
fear	fairytale_sentences	"Do you hear? he answers 'Yes,' but he fears that we shall not like to look at him."
fear	fairytale_sentences	"Will you come and help me hold it?" said the farmer, going towards the chest in which his wife had hidden the sexton, who now lay inside, very much frightened.
fear	fairytale_sentences	"No, leave it alone," cried the sexton from within the chest; "let me out first."
fear	fairytale_sentences	"Oh," exclaimed Little Claus, pretending to be frightened, "he is in there still, is he?
fear	fairytale_sentences	"Oh, no; oh, no," cried the sexton; "I will give you a whole bushel full of money if you will let me go.
anger	fairytale_sentences	"He is making fools of us," said they all; then the shoemakers took their straps, and the tanners their leather aprons, and began to beat Great Claus.
anger	fairytale_sentences	"Skins, skins!" they cried, mocking him; "yes, we'll mark your skin for you, till it is black and blue."
anger	fairytale_sentences	"Out of the town with him," said they.
fear	fairytale_sentences	And Great Claus was obliged to run as fast as he could, he had never before been so thoroughly beaten.
anger	fairytale_sentences	"Ah," said he, as he came to his house; "Little Claus shall pay me for this; I will beat him to death."
anger	fairytale_sentences	"There," cried he, "now you cannot make a fool of me again;" and then he went home.
anger	fairytale_sentences	The landlord was a rich man, and a good man too; but as passionate as if he had been made of pepper and snuff.
anger	fairytale_sentences	Again and again he bawled it out, but as she did not stir he flew into a passion, and threw the glass of mead in her face; it struck her on the nose, and she fell backwards out of the cart, for she was only seated there, not tied in.
fear	fairytale_sentences	Dear Little Claus, I will give you a bushel of money; I will bury your grandmother as if she were my own; only keep silent, or else they will cut off my head, and that would be disagreeable."
fear	fairytale_sentences	Great Claus got so frightened that he rushed out of the surgery, jumped into the cart, whipped up his horses, and drove home quickly.
fear	fairytale_sentences	The apothecary and all the people thought him mad, and let him drive where he liked.
anger	fairytale_sentences	"You shall pay for this," said Great Claus, as soon as he got into the highroad, "that you shall, Little Claus."
anger	fairytale_sentences	"You have played me another trick," said he.
anger	fairytale_sentences	"First, I killed all my horses, and then my old grandmother, and it is all your fault; but you shall not make a fool of me any more."
anger	fairytale_sentences	So he laid hold of Little Claus round the body, and pushed him into the sack, which he took on his shoulders, saying, "Now I'm going to drown you in the river.
fear	fairytale_sentences	"Oh dear, oh dear," sighed Little Claus in the sack, as he turned and twisted about; but he found he could not loosen the string with which it was tied.
fear	fairytale_sentences	I was frightened, to be sure, while I lay tied up in the sack, and the wind whistled in my ears when you threw me into the river from the bridge, and I sank to the bottom immediately; but I did not hurt myself, for I fell upon beautifully soft grass which grows down there; and in a moment, the sack opened, and the sweetest little maiden came towards me.
anger	fairytale_sentences	"Tin soldier," said the goblin, "don't wish for what does not belong to you.
fear	fairytale_sentences	The paper boat rocked up and down, and turned itself round sometimes so quickly that the tin soldier trembled; yet he remained firm; his countenance did not change; he looked straight before him, and shouldered his musket.
fear	fairytale_sentences	"Where am I going now?" thought he.
fear	fairytale_sentences	The poor little elf was very much frightened.
fear	fairytale_sentences	The hat was on the head now, which made it very dark, and the little elf shuddered with fright and indignation at the wicked deed.
anger	fairytale_sentences	But her wicked brother scolded her, and asked her if she was going mad.
anger	fairytale_sentences	He could not imagine why she was weeping over that flower-pot, and it annoyed him.
anger	fairytale_sentences	"That is nothing to you," replied the witch; "you have the money, now give me the tinder-box."
anger	fairytale_sentences	"I tell you what," said the soldier, "if you don't tell me what you are going to do with it, I will draw my sword and cut off your head."
anger	fairytale_sentences	"No," said the witch.
fear	fairytale_sentences	In the morning he could see through the iron grating of the little window how the people were hastening out of the town to see him hanged; he heard the drums beating, and saw the soldiers marching.
fear	fairytale_sentences	"Help me now, that I may not be hanged," cried the soldier.
fear	fairytale_sentences	The country people say that this appearance is caused by lightning; but I will tell you what the sparrow says, and the sparrow heard it from an old willow-tree which grew near a field of buckwheat, and is there still.
anger	fairytale_sentences	But the buckwheat spread itself out with pride, and said, "Stupid tree; he is so old that grass grows out of his body."
fear	fairytale_sentences	There arose a very terrible storm.
fear	fairytale_sentences	All the field-flowers folded their leaves together, or bowed their little heads, while the storm passed over them, but the buckwheat stood erect in its pride.
fear	fairytale_sentences	"Bend your head as we do," said the flowers.
anger	fairytale_sentences	"I have no occasion to do so," replied the buckwheat.
fear	fairytale_sentences	"Bend your head as we do," cried the ears of corn; "the angel of the storm is coming; his wings spread from the sky above to the earth beneath.
fear	fairytale_sentences	He will strike you down before you can cry for mercy."
anger	fairytale_sentences	"But I will not bend my head," said the buckwheat.
fear	fairytale_sentences	"Close your flowers and bend your leaves," said the old willow-tree.
fear	fairytale_sentences	"Do not look at the lightning when the cloud bursts; even men cannot do that.
fear	fairytale_sentences	In a flash of lightning heaven opens, and we can look in; but the sight will strike even human beings blind.
fear	fairytale_sentences	What then must happen to us, who only grow out of the earth, and are so inferior to them, if we venture to do so?"
anger	fairytale_sentences	"Inferior, indeed!" said the buckwheat.
anger	fairytale_sentences	"Now I intend to have a peep into heaven."
anger	fairytale_sentences	"Well," quoth Jack the Dullard, "If I can't have a horse, I'll take the Billy-goat, who belongs to me, and he can carry me very well!"
fear	fairytale_sentences	All the inhabitants of the country round about stood in great crowds around the castle, almost under the very windows, to see the Princess receive the suitors; and as each stepped into the hall, his power of speech seemed to desert him, like the light of a candle that is blown out.
fear	fairytale_sentences	In the autumn, as usual, the wood-cutters came and cut down several of the tallest trees, and the young fir-tree, which was now grown to its full height, shuddered as the noble trees fell to the earth with a crash.
anger	fairytale_sentences	"It would take too much time to explain," said the stork, flying quickly away.
fear	fairytale_sentences	"And then," asked the fir-tree, trembling through all its branches, "and then what happens?"
fear	fairytale_sentences	How the fir-tree trembled!
fear	fairytale_sentences	"What was going to happen to him now?"
fear	fairytale_sentences	After this, the tree tried not to tremble at all, though the fire frightened him; he was so anxious not to hurt any of the beautiful ornaments, even while their brilliancy dazzled him.
fear	fairytale_sentences	Whenever the bottom of the trunk cracked, he was in a great fright, for if the trunk fell to pieces he would have made a tremendous somerset over the trees.
anger	fairytale_sentences	"'I certainly am vexed,' said the basket; 'inwardly vexed, more than any one can imagine.
fear	fairytale_sentences	But the garter was naturally shy, and did not know how to answer such a question.
anger	fairytale_sentences	"Get away; don't come so near me," said the garter, "you appear to me quite like a man."
anger	fairytale_sentences	"What! is he going to propose to me?" said the scissors, and she became so angry that she cut too sharply into the shirt collar, and it was obliged to be thrown by as useless.
anger	fairytale_sentences	"Not all can be born cucumbers; there must be other things, too.
fear	fairytale_sentences	In the night there was a terrible storm.
fear	fairytale_sentences	The hens, chicks, and even the cock sought shelter; the wind tore down the planks between the two yards with a crash; the tiles came tumbling down, but the weather-cock sat firm.
anger	fairytale_sentences	He had been born old, and did not at all resemble the birds flying in the air- the sparrows, and the swallows; no, he despised them, these mean little piping birds, these common whistlers.
anger	fairytale_sentences	He admitted that the pigeons, large and white and shining like mother-o'-pearl, looked like a kind of weather-cock; but they were fat and stupid, and all their thoughts and endeavours were directed to filling themselves with food, and besides, they were tiresome things to converse with.
anger	fairytale_sentences	All this was new and interesting; that is, for the first time, but afterwards, as the weather-cock found out, they repeated themselves and always told the same stories, and that's very tedious, and there was no one with whom one could associate, for one and all were stale and small-minded.
anger	fairytale_sentences	"The world is no good!" he said.
anger	fairytale_sentences	"Everything in it is so stupid."
anger	fairytale_sentences	The weather-cock was puffed up, and that quality would have made him interesting in the eyes of the cucumber if it had known it, but it had eyes only for the yard cock, who was now in the yard with it.
anger	fairytale_sentences	"What do you think of that crowing?" said the yard cock to the hens and chickens.
anger	fairytale_sentences	"Everything is very stupid," the weather-cock said to himself.
anger	fairytale_sentences	"The yard cock lays no eggs, and I am too lazy to do so; if I liked, I could lay a wind-egg.
anger	fairytale_sentences	But the world is not worth even a wind-egg.
anger	fairytale_sentences	Everything is so stupid!
anger	fairytale_sentences	I don't want to sit here any longer."
anger	fairytale_sentences	But the goblin felt very angry that any man should venture to say such things to a huckster who was a householder and sold the best butter.
fear	fairytale_sentences	No one could tell, for terror had seized upon all.
anger	fairytale_sentences	"Did I not say so?" said the darning-needle, "I know I am too fine for such work as that."
fear	fairytale_sentences	"Now I am going on a journey," said the needle, as she floated away with the dirty water, "I do hope I shall not be lost."
fear	fairytale_sentences	"White walls, and I am black myself," said the darning-needle, "that looks well; now I can be seen, but I hope I shall not be sea-sick, or I shall break again."
fear	fairytale_sentences	I am breaking!" but she did not break, though the waggon went over her as she lay at full length; and there let her lie.
fear	fairytale_sentences	"Don't speak so loud, or she will wake," said the toad, "and then she might run away, for she is as light as swan's down.
anger	fairytale_sentences	"Now don't be obstinate, or I shall bite you with my white teeth.
anger	fairytale_sentences	"Away, away," barked the old yard-dog.
anger	fairytale_sentences	I know nothing of any nightingale.
anger	fairytale_sentences	Is there such a bird in my empire? and even in my garden?
anger	fairytale_sentences	I will hear the nightingale, she must be here this evening; she has my highest favor; and if she does not come, the whole court shall be trampled upon after supper is ended."
anger	fairytale_sentences	Sing! sing!"
anger	fairytale_sentences	"Stop! stop!" and the words came quite clear, though they were like the croak of a frog, or the wail of a bird.
anger	fairytale_sentences	"A grave! dig me a grave!"
anger	fairytale_sentences	He nodded, and pointed to Anne Lisbeth, crying out, "Hold fast! hold fast! and then you may ride again in a nobleman's carriage, and forget your child."
anger	fairytale_sentences	He's angry to-day.
anger	fairytale_sentences	"'Snik, snak, snurre, bassellurre!
anger	fairytale_sentences	I'm master of this house!
anger	fairytale_sentences	Snikke, snakke, snak!
anger	fairytale_sentences	Oh! pray let me out, And like a lamb led to slaughter I'll betroth you, no doubt, To my daughter.'"
anger	fairytale_sentences	But the professor did not approve of such nonsense, so he clapped his hands on the nettle to stop it.
anger	fairytale_sentences	Then the leaves, which are its fingers, stung him so sharply that he has never ventured to touch a nettle since."
anger	fairytale_sentences	So she took the doll out, who looked quite cross, and said not a single word, for she was angry at being turned out of her bed.
anger	fairytale_sentences	"Why did not somebody tell me?"
anger	fairytale_sentences	And they hacked away at him, and they pulled at him, and ate him up, because of the little bruise.
anger	fairytale_sentences	But now she had to come out, and they tugged at her, and pulled her about, and ate her up.
anger	fairytale_sentences	"Yes; but what do you think it is?" said Kribble-Krabble.
anger	fairytale_sentences	"Look out for the drumsticks," replied Peter; and, small as he was, he ran up boldly, and gave the foremost such a punch in the body with his fist, that the fellow lost his legs and tumbled over, and the others took their legs off with themselves very rapidly.
anger	fairytale_sentences	"Yes, we have my boy," she retorted.
anger	fairytale_sentences	And then Martha repeated to the laundress, in a very few minutes, all that the mayor had said to her boy, which she had overheard; and she felt very angry that any man could speak, as he had done, of a mother to her own child, about the few drops she had taken; and she was still more angry because, on that very day, the mayor was going to have a dinner-party, at which there would be wine, strong, rich wine, drunk by the bottle.
anger	fairytale_sentences	"Many will take more than they ought, but they don't call that drinking!
anger	fairytale_sentences	They are all right, you are good for nothing indeed!" cried Martha indignantly.
anger	fairytale_sentences	"How should there be room in a little nut like this for the best thing of all?
anger	fairytale_sentences	"You must not shout so," said the sentry.
anger	fairytale_sentences	Her Puggie had seated itself on the ground while she wrote, and growled; for the dog had come with her for amusement and for the sake of its health; and then the bare floor ought not to be offered to a visitor.
